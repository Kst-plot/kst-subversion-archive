0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Media support
       o Make media menu, cmdline option and dcop call itentical:
               + usbdisk camera: dcop call should magicly umount as cmdline
                 option and Media menu
       o download dialog when opened via dcop do
               o goto desktop digikam is currently running, and unminimize and
                 put on top
       o CRASH: with 2 download dialog
               digikam --detect-camera         # don't close download dialog
               dcop digikam-<pid> camera cameraAutodetect # dialog open with error; closing
                                                       the dialog ==> CRASH

	o Testing 3 plug cases (camera is here gphoto _and_ usm)
		1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
			-> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
			   be in the list. 
		2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
			-> as 1) but already instance should be used
			(uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
			if necessary
		3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
		   camera is already connected
			-> camera menu allows to 
				select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
				to start download dialog
		  		ditto for unmounting in usm case 

Main Interface : 

    - ImageInfo class must handle properly image dimension like in image properties sidebar tab. 
      (Set on Album Icon item dimensions on setup must give the same result than image properties)

* Image Properties SideBar:

   - Added signal/slots control between IE and main interface about "comments & tags" tab.
     Comments & tags set from main must be updated in IE and vise-versa.
     
* Image Editor : 

   - If Comments & tags informations have been changed, notify DImg instance of current image to set
     informations in metadata bytes array (COM, EXIF, IPTC).

* Showfoto: 

   - Open a JPG file and FileSaveAs to new file: The file is saved and after that thumbbar have loaded the 
     new image thumbnail, showfoto said that the preview "image has been changed, do you want to save it!".
     Note: no option about auto-rotate using Exif tag is enable.
   - In SlideShow with fullscreen mode enable, the vertically oriented image automaticily rotated using
     Exif tags are toggle on to save when SlideShow is complete.
   - During saving a new file, if space disk is full, we have a crash!
 
B.K.O files to fix :

==> 93569   (CameraGUI: easier connection to USB disc cameras)
==> 125696  (CameraGUI: digikam does not connect to USB camera with libgphoto-2.1.99)
==> 114211  (Main Interface: image comments encoding unreadable after moving an album)
==> 120241  (Main Interface: utf8 display and edit)
==> 116148  (Image Editor:   auto-scrolling when selecting large area)
==> 111446  (Image Editor:   bad behaviour when out of disk space)

LATER 0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* post conversion to qlistview: allow selection of multiple
  albums/tags/dates :

     "current urls"
