0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Media support
       o Make media menu, cmdline option and dcop call itentical:
               + usbdisk camera: dcop call should magicly umount as cmdline
                 option and Media menu
       o download dialog when opened via dcop do
               o goto desktop digikam is currently running, and unminimize and
                 put on top
       o CRASH: with 2 download dialog
               digikam --detect-camera         # don't close download dialog
               dcop digikam-<pid> camera cameraAutodetect # dialog open with error; closing
                                                       the dialog ==> CRASH

	o Testing 3 plug cases (camera is here gphoto _and_ usm)
		1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
			-> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
			   be in the list. 
		2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
			-> as 1) but already instance should be used
			(uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
			if necessary
		3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
		   camera is already connected
			-> camera menu allows to 
				select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
				to start download dialog
		  		ditto for unmounting in usm case 

* Image Properties SideBar:

   - update ImagePropertiesMetadataTab on ImageAttributesWatch's signalFileMetadataChanged
     (ImageAttributesWatch is libdigikam, the metadatatab is used by showfoto - create subclass ImagePropertiesMetadataTabDB?)

* Showfoto: 

   - In SlideShow with fullscreen mode enable, the vertically oriented image automaticily rotated using
     Exif tags are toggle on to save when SlideShow is complete.

* General: 

   - Something is broken in ICC workflow if ICC profile repository set in digiKam configuration have been deleted. There is no test at startup to check this point.


B.K.O files to fix :

==> 93569   (CameraGUI: easier connection to USB disc cameras)
==> 125696  (CameraGUI: digikam does not connect to USB camera with libgphoto-2.1.99)
==> 116148  (Image Editor:   auto-scrolling when selecting large area)
==> 111446  (Image Editor:   bad behaviour when out of disk space)
