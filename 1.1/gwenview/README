Gwenview - http://gwenview.sourceforge.net



-> What is it ?

Gwenview is a simple image viewer for KDE. It features a folder tree window
and a file list window to provide easy navigation in your file hierarchy.
Image loading is done by Qt library, so it supports all image formats your
Qt installation supports.


-> Requirements

KDE 3.1 or more.


-> Installation

 ./configure
 make
 make install

If configure fails to find your Qt or KDE libs, you will have to type
  'export KDEDIR=/path/to/kde'
and 
  'export QTDIR=/path/to/Qt/lib'


-> Uninstallation

 make uninstall


-> Tips concerning docked windows

Docked windows are great, but they take a little time to get
accustomed to. Here comes a few tips that you might find handy.

- While dragging a window, press Esc to cancel the drag.

- After undocking a window, if you want to dock it back, don't drag it
with the title bar, it won't dock. Drag the little horizontal grip
below the title bar instead. You may also click on the small arrow in
the top right corner, this will get it back to its previous docked place.

- If you closed a window you can get it back using the "Window" menu.

- To dock window A on an edge of window B, drag the grip of A to the wanted
edge. To make A and B use tabs, drag the grip of A on the center of B.


-> Mouse operations

You can browse through your image using the Opera-like previous-next mouse
navigation: Keep the left mouse button down and click on the right button to
go to the next image. Keep the right mouse button down and click on the left
button to go to the previous one.
Thanks to Michael Spanier for sending me a patch which started this new feature.

You can also scroll your image by holding the left mouse button down and
moving the mouse around.

Middle mouse will toggle the auto zoom on and off.

By default, the mouse wheel will either scroll the image vertically or go to
previous/next image. This can be configured in the configure dialog.

Use Shift + mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Use Ctrl + mouse wheel to scroll the image horizontally.
