FAQ:
----
Q: I want to compile application X for KDE 3.1 and I know
that this application supports KDE 3.1. But configure tells me
that I need KDE 3.2

A: Open the file 'configure.in.in' with your favourite editor
and change the line '#MIN_CONFIG(3.2)' to '#MIN_CONFIG(3.1)'.
Afterwards do the usual
'make -f Makefile.cvs && ./configure && cd XXX && make'
Don't forget to replace XXX with the name of the application :-)
If you have commit rights, please make sure to not commit the modified
configure.in.in.
