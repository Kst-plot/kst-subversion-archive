Known issues in 1.1.0:
- If you experience crashes with the distributed fit and filter plugins, it is
likely a problem with your GSL libraries and recent linker options.  The problem
is resolved by removing -Wl,--as-needed from linking stages for these plugins,
but there is no easy workaround available at this time.
- ASCII time input has been disabled because it's not usable yet.
- Input of time values only works in relative mode right now (offset from the
first sample).
