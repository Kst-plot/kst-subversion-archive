Filters
-------
Filters are plugins (parallel to fits)	(Andrew)	
Modify existing filter-like plugins     (Andrew)
Filter-sets act like filters            (Andrew)


Drag and Drop    (George for all of this)
-------------

- Factories need to register earlier and automatically for each view object type
- Rename plots that cause namespace conflicts
- DCOP ID needs to be stored for callback
- Callback for objects that we need
- Drag across processes
- Drop target rect
- Feedback on errors


Objects
-------
- KstPlotLegend (partial rework)                    (Andrew)
- Option to make background transparent or filled   (George)
- undo/redo
	- must use the marshalling code
- draw(QPainter&, ...) needs to be rethought slightly in Kst2DPlot and pushed
  up the chain.


Integration
-----------
- Algorithm to layout new plots cleanly
- DCOP interface				(George)
- Concept of "New" might need to change


KstViewLabel
------------
- Scalar replacement                
- Edit dialog integration           (Andrew)
- Rotation                          (George)


Fun Stuff
---------
- Provide alternate drag mimetypes?
	- maybe even XML?
- Opaque move/resize
	- too slow?
- Stored drag should write a signature, and then drags can be dropped on the
  desktop into a file and then dragged to a Kst window another time.
  	- This conflicts with image dropping.
