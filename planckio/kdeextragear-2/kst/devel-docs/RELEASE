How to make a Kst release:

- update from CVS
- run a regression test and make sure it completely passes
- update kst/main.cpp to set the version number
- set the version numbers in kst.lsm and kst.spec.in
- tag CVS
- make sure configure has been run so that the spec file is created (with the
  appropriate prefix, otherwise it must be editted after)
- cvs2dist /path/to/kdeextragear-2 kst -n kst -v <version_number> -d
- generate the srpm: rpm -ts kst-version.tar.gz
- generate rpms as needed: rpm -tb kst-version.tar.gz
                        or rpm --rebuild kst-version.rpm
     - SuSE and RedHat style are typically generated.

- TEST

- update www/areas/extragear/inc/appinfo.inc

- update kst/main.cpp, kst.lsm, kst.spec.in to the next release 0.xx-devel
