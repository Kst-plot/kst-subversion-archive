2004-04-23 Friday 12:53  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT right branch this time

2004-04-23 Friday 12:52  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-04-23 Friday 11:57  arwalker

	* 	Better handle resizing by only updating the aspect of child windows when necessary. This now allows us to shrink the parent to a very small size and retain the correct aspect ratios when the parent is restored to its original size.

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:50  staikos

	* 	parentResized() should be recursive as noted, but updateFromAspect() should
	not be. - revert last, fix parentResized()

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:46  staikos

	* 	also dead

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:45  staikos

	* 	no reason to disable this in HEAD now

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:44  staikos

	* 	dead

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:42  staikos

	* 	remove view code

2004-04-22 Thursday 21:28  arwalker

	* 	Make things truly recursive so we can resize deeper than one level.

2004-04-22 Thursday 20:35  arwalker

	* 	Added ability to distinguish between a standard fit and a regular plugin.

2004-04-22 Thursday 20:30  arwalker

	* 	Added ability to distinguish between a standard fit and a regular plugin.

2004-04-22 Thursday 15:07  arwalker

	* 	Added support for specifying the curve line width and style.

2004-04-22 Thursday 14:52  arwalker

	* 	Added support for curve line width and style.

2004-04-22 Thursday 13:14  netterfield

	* 	Shouldn't have commited Makefile.am...

2004-04-22 Thursday 13:13  netterfield

	* 	new kst_datawizard icon...

2004-04-22 Thursday 10:05  arwalker

	* 	Added an update button to handle the situation where the ELOG server
	becomes available after starting Kst, or the ELOG server configuration
	is changed.

2004-04-22 Thursday 09:46  arwalker

	* 	Several minor UI enhancements

2004-04-21 Wednesday 18:53  arwalker

	* 	Added optimization of the event monitor reporting. Up to 100 messages
	are now batched together if they occur within one minute of each other.

2004-04-21 Wednesday 16:14  arwalker

	* 	Add a description for events, and use it if available.
	If no description is given then use the expression
	text itself.

2004-04-20 Tuesday 12:53  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-04-20 Tuesday 12:52  staikos

	* 	various bug fixes, label dragging

2004-04-20 Tuesday 11:55  staikos

	* 	store the ascent information, fix computation of it, and therefore position the
	label properly in the buffer

2004-04-20 Tuesday 06:20  staikos

	* 	added computation of the text geometry for the selected font and size, and
	support for justification.  Will need to split this into ascent and descent
	since subscript makes the text dip below the baseline.

2004-04-20 Tuesday 05:22  staikos

	* 	implement ^ _ and {} in labels

2004-04-20 Tuesday 03:37  staikos

	* 	back buffer implementation

2004-04-20 Tuesday 03:37  staikos

	* 	a good chunk of the label parsing and rendering code.

	the parser will be slightly reworked after this.

2004-04-18 Sunday 02:17  staikos

	* 	added support for dragging plot groups and undoing drags when re-entering the
	view that started the drag.  drag re-enter is buggy still.

2004-04-18 Sunday 02:15  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-04-18 Sunday 01:13  staikos

	* 	save and restore bordered view object properties too, and allow other view
	objects to save/restore their properties

2004-04-16 Friday 04:02  staikos

	* 	clear the selection when changing out of layout mode

2004-04-16 Friday 03:55  staikos

	* 	my list

2004-04-16 Friday 03:41  staikos

	* 	dragging of Kst2DPlots is now partially functional within Kst instances.

2004-04-16 Friday 02:15  staikos

	* 	more files, create a second view to test dnd

2004-04-16 Friday 02:14  staikos

	* 	lots of view work, including most of drag and drop implemented - though it's
	still not functional

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:56  arwalker

	* 	Some minor improvements to data mode:

	* remove the flicker when the mouse is moved, but the same data point remains selected
	* draw the data mode indicator more efficiently

	Also, if the x vector is not monotonic then we are stuck doing a linear search (N) for the nearest point. It might be worthwhile to do a quicksort of the vector (NlogN) which would initially be more costly but subsequent mouse moves would be much quicker. Given that there will generally be a lot of mouse moves while in data mode it will most likely be more efficient in the long run.

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:32  staikos

	* 	ah now I understand, you didn't want orphans, you just wanted them to not be
	saved

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:20  staikos

	* 	make these scalars really orphan

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:49  staikos

	* 	proper fix for the bug in the list partitioner

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:44  staikos

	* 	add testcase for bug recently fixed

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:42  arwalker

	* 	Added some default scalar values that define some (hopefully) useful physical constants.
	These are deliberately orphaned so they are not saved with every kst file.

2004-04-15 Thursday 12:54  arwalker

	* 	Prevent stray curves from remaining after we do File...New

2004-04-15 Thursday 11:57  arwalker

	* 	This makes the whole thing work.

2004-04-15 Thursday 01:50  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-14 Wednesday 19:40  arwalker

	* 	The plugin dialog update( ... ) function is really two seperate functions.
	One for updating the list of scalars and vectors within the input comboboxes
	and the other (already existing) to handle changes in the plugin itself.
	These functions have now been split, as previously creating a new
	scalar or vector within the plugin dialog would cause any modified
	settings to revert back to those of the last created plugin.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 18:10  mueller

	* 	fix compile

2004-04-14 Wednesday 15:21  arwalker

	* 	Fixed build problems.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 15:12  arwalker

	* 	Added plugin for addition of Gaussian noise (of specified sigma) to a vector

2004-04-14 Wednesday 15:09  arwalker

	* 	Prevent name conflicts

2004-04-14 Wednesday 14:33  arwalker

	* 	Make sure the buffer is large enough.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 12:42  arwalker

	* 	Do some translation and draw the line breaking input and output across the entire width of the dialog.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 12:29  arwalker

	* 	Plugin objects are updated as part of the ncl list now the underlying problem is fixed.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 12:22  arwalker

	* 	Ensure that we don't add a NULL pointer to the exclusive list.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 20:52  staikos

	* 	don't mask bugs, crash and then generate a bt with testcase so it can be fixed.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 19:01  arwalker

	* 	Modification based on tests now that plugins are functional again.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 17:18  arwalker

	* 	Update the plugin vectors in the new threading model.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 15:37  arwalker

	* 	Perform some additional checks before using potentially invalid
	pointers. This prevents Kst from crashing when using plugins.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 15:18  arwalker

	* 	Removed obsolete code.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 14:43  arwalker

	* 	Added ability to later limit the number of log messages retained.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 13:24  staikos

	* 	not needed now

2004-04-13 Tuesday 02:33  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-12 Monday 21:41  staikos

	* 	starting to define a back buffer for painting plots and labels into

2004-04-12 Monday 20:57  staikos

	* 	make the menus cascade when necessary, add ungrouping, more minor things

2004-04-12 Monday 18:44  staikos

	* 	selection should be iterative over children, not recursive

2004-04-12 Monday 18:23  staikos

	* 	added object grouping, fixed some bugs that showed up due to it

2004-04-11 Sunday 12:57  staikos

	* 	Minor move, selection fixlets, and draw the bounding focus rect for a selection
	move instead of just the object that is focused.  This will later be changed to
	draw the focus rect for each object individually.  Bounds checking for move
	operations was added.

2004-04-11 Sunday 04:32  staikos

	* 	allow selection of objects and move the selected items along with an item
	that is selected and moved.  Does not check bounds on selected items or draw
	the selected item shadows yet.  Selection markers are ugly. Resizing clears
	the selection.

2004-04-10 Saturday 20:57  staikos

	* 	fix nasty bug on PPC and possibly some other architectures

2004-04-10 Saturday 19:43  staikos

	* 	added the framework for labels in the new view engine
	The label parser and renderer needs a few changes before it can be ported over

2004-04-10 Saturday 16:44  staikos

	* 	preserve aspect ratio during resize to keep with current Kst behaviour
	(also keeps relative sizing and positioning - basically the entire geometry
	aspect is preserved)

2004-04-09 Friday 16:54  arwalker

	* 	A few UI issues

2004-04-09 Friday 16:32  arwalker

	* 	Saves the event monitor entries to the kst file

2004-04-09 Friday 10:03  deller

	* 	fix misplaced #endif - it broke when compiling w/ KDE CVS HEAD

2004-04-08 Thursday 20:22  arwalker

	* 	Add functionality to prepare event monitor for saving to kst file

2004-04-08 Thursday 19:43  arwalker

	* 	Event monitoring (in draft form) are now working:

	- all output is to the debug log
	- may want to add e-mail notification
	- may want to add visual feedback on curve, but it seems
	if this is the intent it could be done via the creation of an
	equation curve

2004-04-08 Thursday 16:54  arwalker

	* 	Make the search for a unique Analysis Scalar and unique Anonymous
	Vector more efficient by remembering the last name that was used.

2004-04-08 Thursday 16:12  arwalker

	* 	Removed a FIXME related to i18n not working

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:56  staikos

	* 	much less flicker, and add new menu items for z-order manipulation

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:07  arwalker

	* 	Provide a more efficient way to terminate the update thread
	Respect the plot update timer value

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:04  arwalker

	* 	This is what was intended

2004-04-08 Thursday 12:59  arwalker

	* 	Have KstView::printToGraphicsFile( ... ) return a bool to indicate whether or not it was successful.

2004-04-08 Thursday 06:23  staikos

	* 	use "standard actions" that might be common across different view objects to
	reduce the effort it takes to write new objects

2004-04-08 Thursday 03:10  staikos

	* 	iron out some context menu buglets (I'm getting good at finding weird mouse
	combinations), remove debug, and add in a bit smoother mouse movement.

2004-04-08 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	* 	add a parent pointer, optimize a call, disable selection when not in
	layout mode

2004-04-08 Thursday 01:11  staikos

	* 	that's a slot, not a signal

2004-04-08 Thursday 00:57  staikos

	* 	fix some more weird mouse handling cases that were unhandled, add in menu
	titles

2004-04-07 Wednesday 22:25  staikos

	* 	- many little fixlets in event handling.  some of them brown-paper-bag worthy
	- implemented popup menu plugin for objects
	- implemented deletion of objects from the context menu
	- enhanced the object API
	- optimized the rubberband.  it's now less flickery than the ones in Qt
	  and KDE even! (might just have to port this over)

2004-04-07 Wednesday 20:53  arwalker

	* 	Made event monitor UI fit better with existing architecture

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:33  arwalker

	* 	Removed an obsolete FIXME annotation

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:25  staikos

	* 	the usual

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:22  arwalker

	* 	Protect ourselves from the application also closing

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:06  arwalker

	* 	Ensure a newly created extension is added to the relevant list so we know how to delete it and can avoid creating it again

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:05  arwalker

	* 	Ensure that the UI associated with the extension is removed when it is unloaded

2004-04-07 Wednesday 06:24  staikos

	* 	added the start of drag objects for Kst objects and did some work on cleaning
	up coordinates and making view resize work like the old Kst views (still very
	far from working)

2004-04-07 Wednesday 03:25  staikos

	* 	bounding for the rectangles for resize, select, and move, and some fixlets

2004-04-07 Wednesday 01:30  staikos

	* 	rubber banding during move, resize, and selection.  selection is not
	implemented yet.  also fix a few buglets

2004-04-06 Tuesday 19:57  arwalker

	* 	Continuing with the event monitoring

2004-04-06 Tuesday 16:46  staikos

	* 	start the view in display mode now and add a checkbox to toggle layout mode
	in the test app (defaulted to on)

2004-04-06 Tuesday 16:24  staikos

	* 	allow moving of objects

2004-04-06 Tuesday 15:20  staikos

	* 	those coordinate calculations were wrong for top-left

2004-04-06 Tuesday 14:59  staikos

	* 	Added mouse-driven object resizing - still requires user-feedback on size

2004-04-06 Tuesday 13:51  staikos

	* 	oops :)

2004-04-06 Tuesday 13:47  staikos

	* 	set the cursor over objects

2004-04-06 Tuesday 12:54  staikos

	* 	Well it was too difficult to use "math" coordinates.  I was confusing myself
	endlessly.  Let's go back to u-l.  This makes cleanup work properly.  Now all
	features implemented so far are working.

2004-04-06 Tuesday 02:43  staikos

	* 	fix focus rect and child searching

2004-04-06 Tuesday 02:24  staikos

	* 	fix size coordinates

2004-04-05 Monday 23:43  staikos

	* 	cleanup, clear, painting and sizing fixes - it's really broken now though, need
	to fix a few more things this broke (later)

2004-04-05 Monday 23:12  staikos

	* 	more substantial demo of focus handling, drag&drop event handling partially
	done, selected flag added. view mode tracking added

2004-04-05 Monday 22:49  staikos

	* 	lots of work on the new view code - painting and resizing works, focus works,
	and lots of utility functions added to the view object.  Event handlers are
	created but not all in use yet.

2004-04-05 Monday 15:34  arwalker

	* 	Continue with event monitoring

2004-04-05 Monday 13:28  arwalker

	* 	Update the event monitor dialog

2004-04-05 Monday 03:28  staikos

	* 	some notes and geometry code

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:47  staikos

	* 	to keep the code that uses this for comparisons cleaner

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:29  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:26  staikos

	* 	Add in explicit deep copy support.  Been testing this one for a week now and
	it seems to be better and not much slower.  We need to make deep copies of the
	object lists we iterate if they are shared across threads.

2004-04-04 Sunday 00:42  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-03 Saturday 00:57  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-02 Friday 20:35  arwalker

	* 	Get the event monitor expression parser working again

2004-04-02 Friday 20:34  arwalker

	* 	Removed compiler warnings and superfluous commas

2004-04-02 Friday 20:33  arwalker

	* 	Removed a compiler warning and superfluous commas

2004-04-02 Friday 20:32  arwalker

	* 	Be more explicit in the value returned for the comparison operators

2004-04-01 Thursday 19:42  arwalker

	* 	Improve performance of the log table

2004-04-01 Thursday 17:12  arwalker

	* 	Minor UI enhancements

2004-04-01 Thursday 14:51  arwalker

	* 	Why not to use regexp's for string replacement

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:43  staikos

	* 	no it really doesn't :-)

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:39  staikos

	* 	make code generation one step shorter

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:36  staikos

	* 	use the global scanner

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:36  staikos

	* 	share the scanner between the two parsers

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:22  staikos

	* 	unneeded.  They just duplicate the existing one and add a few things.

	exparse updated to use the old one again, but this stuff isn't integrated into
	the build so I haven't tested it yet

2004-03-31 Wednesday 22:19  staikos

	* 	no reason to duplicate these files verbatim.  I moved exnode* into here.

2004-03-31 Wednesday 20:42  arwalker

	* 	Refer to event monitoring "equations" as expressions to avoid naming confusion with equations curves

2004-03-31 Wednesday 20:40  arwalker

	* 	Added files for evaluation of event monitoring expressions

2004-03-30 Tuesday 18:41  staikos

	* 	added registry for extensions

2004-03-30 Tuesday 17:34  staikos

	* 	most of the extension manager implement.  Just requires an "extension registry"
	to keep track of what is already loaded so that new ones can be loaded after
	startup

2004-03-30 Tuesday 16:15  arwalker

	* 	Added UI for event monitoring

2004-03-30 Tuesday 10:41  staikos

	* 	Andrew please add this file

2004-03-30 Tuesday 10:30  staikos

	* 	added extension manager dialog (not yet functional)
	extensions now have a bool flag that determines if they are enabled by default

2004-03-29 Monday 20:39  arwalker

	* 	Add internationalisation

2004-03-29 Monday 19:16  arwalker

	* 	Added option to save the Kst debugging information to an ELOG entry.

2004-03-29 Monday 13:42  arwalker

	* 	Added the pass filters to the build

2004-03-29 Monday 12:25  arwalker

	* 	Added the ELOG functionality to the build

2004-03-29 Monday 01:33  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-28 Sunday 20:24  staikos

	* 	more of the new view code

2004-03-28 Sunday 05:24  staikos

	* 	more of the new view object structure implemented

2004-03-27 Saturday 01:28  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-26 Friday 23:29  staikos

	* 	more of the new object structure

2004-03-26 Friday 16:46  arwalker

	* 	Avoid some potential deadlocks where a write lock is never unlocked.

2004-03-26 Friday 15:03  arwalker

	* 	Modified the tab order and layout

2004-03-26 Friday 13:42  arwalker

	* 	Added Kst version informatoin to the email text.
	Added labels for the different message types.

2004-03-26 Friday 12:40  arwalker

	* 	Added ability to hide any specified messages types.
	Move the generation of the e-mail text to another function
	so that it could be used by other clients (such as elog).

2004-03-26 Friday 11:06  arwalker

	* 	Added for log table...

2004-03-26 Friday 09:05  staikos

	* 	hm no, the file is missing from cvs.

2004-03-26 Friday 08:23  staikos

	* 	don't exist?

2004-03-26 Friday 01:34  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-25 Thursday 21:35  arwalker

	* 	Make debug dialog more flexible for further enhancements...

2004-03-22 Monday 02:06  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-20 Saturday 01:49  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-19 Friday 02:48  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-03-18 Thursday 17:35  arwalker

	* 	Added additional folders

2004-03-18 Thursday 17:29  arwalker

	* 	Typo.

2004-03-18 Thursday 17:26  arwalker

	* 	Added Butterworth pass filters (low, high, band, and notch)

2004-03-18 Thursday 16:48  arwalker

	* 	Prevented deadlock by moving:
	KstWriteLocker wl(&KST::vectorList.lock());
	beyond the call to vy = new KstRVector( ... )

	The problem was that KstRVector implicitly
	performs a write lock on KST::vectorList
	in the KstVector constructor. Hence the
	deadlock.

2004-03-18 Thursday 15:48  arwalker

	* 	Fixed lock

2004-03-18 Thursday 05:59  staikos

	* 	I think this procedure is stable now

2004-03-18 Thursday 04:25  staikos

	* 	revert last - majorly broke loading

2004-03-18 Thursday 04:17  staikos

	* 	"Living on the edge"

	- Add more #ifdef debug groups for debugging the update thread

2004-03-18 Thursday 03:42  staikos

	* 	after a marathon debugging I learn:

	When you #ifdef debug messages, only #ifdef the debug messages, and not the
	code nearby too!

	On a brighter note, fixed some possible races, added more debug messages, etc

2004-03-17 Wednesday 19:28  staikos

	* 	iteration 101

2004-03-17 Wednesday 06:12  coles

	*

	Corrected typos.

2004-03-17 Wednesday 00:02  staikos

	* 	add helgrind support

2004-03-16 Tuesday 23:17  staikos

	* 	trace down lots more nasty locking issues and deadlocks, and get the regression
	suite back to 100% passes again

2004-03-16 Tuesday 17:50  staikos

	* 	playing regression test ping pong

2004-03-16 Tuesday 17:45  staikos

	* 	regression suite told me something was wrong.  I agree.  plugin -1 is not a
	good thing to try to access.

2004-03-16 Tuesday 17:31  arwalker

	* 	Disable the ELOG entry dialog if we are not connected to an ELOG logbook.

2004-03-16 Tuesday 17:28  arwalker

	* 	Updated some translation settings.

2004-03-16 Tuesday 17:12  staikos

	* 	as more people become interested in Kst, I guess it's good to have this stuff
	documented

2004-03-16 Tuesday 15:50  arwalker

	* 	Updated

2004-03-16 Tuesday 15:42  arwalker

	* 	a bunch of threading and updating fixes

2004-03-16 Tuesday 05:04  staikos

	* 	track down what is perhaps the most difficult bug to find in Kst so far:
	can't iteratively lock children and then iteratively unlock them while doing
	a loadInputs() in between because the lists are modified in loadInputs()!
	The base implementation of the lock should be sufficient in this case since it
	only ever happens in KstDoc

	* 	a view to a view

2004-03-11 Thursday 11:20  staikos

	* 	merged the threading branch into HEAD.  Quite buggy still, but will be fixed
	over time.  I recommend using the kst_0_97_release tag if you want a
	functional Kst.

2004-03-11 Thursday 10:11  staikos

	* 	add debugging info, commented out

2004-03-10 Wednesday 23:28  staikos

	* 	- fix axis matching - no wonder, it was autoscaling back to a sane setting
	after I made it insane!

2004-03-08 Monday 22:49  staikos

	* 	oops

2004-03-08 Monday 22:43  staikos

	* 	closer to working.  Also cleanup some of the view vectors dialog.  It's
	still got an undefined signal reference

2004-03-08 Monday 20:18  staikos

	* 	tried to implement axis matching, but it still doesn't work.  KstPlot needs
	to be documented.

2004-03-08 Monday 17:41  arwalker

	* 	Ensure that the vector selector is updated whenever a new vector is created.

2004-03-08 Monday 14:52  staikos

	* 	allow log updates in realtime

2004-03-08 Monday 14:32  staikos

	KstDebug

2004-03-08 Monday 14:04  staikos

	* 	move to using KstDebug

2004-03-08 Monday 04:23  staikos

	* 	Added a debug dialog which shows information such as loaded data sources,
	and a log of Kst events

	Refactored the version number into a header file

2004-03-05 Friday 18:24  staikos

	* 	trying very hard to make an icon for the data wizard.

2004-03-05 Friday 17:38  staikos

	* 	- no need to keep two signals that do the same thing
	- restore designer indenting in .ui.h file
	- deref the vector before emitting signal

2004-03-05 Friday 16:07  arwalker

	* 	Added viewvectorsdialog.cpp and viewvectorsdialog.h

2004-03-05 Friday 16:06  arwalker

2004-03-05 Friday 01:47  staikos

	* 	no wonder it was so slow :)

2004-03-04 Thursday 17:21  staikos

	* 	up to the last attempt to get KXMLGUIClient functionality in JS, for Rich to
	look at

2004-03-04 Thursday 17:10  staikos

	* 	I was wondering why it was still extremely slow, then I saw this.

2004-03-04 Thursday 16:49  staikos

	* 	surprise surprise

2004-03-04 Thursday 16:44  staikos

	* 	make it compile

2004-03-04 Thursday 16:19  arwalker

	* 	Re-enabled the view scalars dialog, with a subclassed QTable, which is more efficient.

2004-03-04 Thursday 16:06  arwalker

	* 	Added subclass of QTable for improved performance.

2004-03-04 Thursday 15:36  staikos

	* 	I guess the label code works better for people when I commit it

2004-03-03 Wednesday 15:55  staikos

	* 	add:
	- starting frame
	- read to end
	- read from end
	- read n samples
	- boxcar filter
	- skip

2004-03-03 Wednesday 15:33  staikos

	fix a few bugs

2004-03-03 Wednesday 09:05  netterfield

	* 	automatic default names get inserted in the plugin dialog if the user
	applies without entering a name.

2004-03-03 Wednesday 01:10  staikos

	* 	data wizard is now mostly functional

2004-03-03 Wednesday 00:30  staikos

	* 	unnecessary

2004-03-01 Monday 23:21  staikos

	* 	Trolltech: *PLEASE* add an option to designer to retain compatibility with
	version X of Qt, or at least leave the old designer version number in the .ui
	file.  This gets tedious!

2004-03-01 Monday 23:09  staikos

	* 	more of the wizard implemented

2004-03-01 Monday 22:24  staikos

	* 	implement half of the wizard

2004-03-01 Monday 20:24  staikos

	* 	here's the data wizard everyone is waiting for.  Not integrated yet.

2004-03-01 Monday 16:37  staikos

	* 	0.97-devel CVS_SILENT

2004-03-01 Monday 16:25  staikos

	* 	crash fix

2004-03-01 Monday 15:53  staikos

2004-03-01 Monday 13:10  arwalker

	* 	Re-enabled the view scalars dialog...

2004-03-01 Monday 12:36  arwalker

	* 	Removed compiler warnings

2004-02-29 Sunday 02:10  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-02-26 Thursday 19:38  staikos

	* 	reverting r1.50

2004-02-26 Thursday 18:51  staikos

	* 	fix a locking bug, and make write locking recursion safe.  This does not apply
	for mixing read and write locking recursively [yet]

2004-02-26 Thursday 14:23  staikos

	* 	don't allow creation of new filters if new ones don't exist

2004-02-25 Wednesday 02:14  staikos

	* 	several deadlock fixes

2004-02-25 Wednesday 00:09  staikos

	* 	forgot this one

2004-02-24 Tuesday 23:23  staikos

	* 	make sure it's erased ;-)

2004-02-24 Tuesday 23:21  staikos

	* 	document loading fixes - now erases objects from kst files if their dependencies
	can't be loaded

2004-02-24 Tuesday 22:33  staikos

	* 	locking fixes

2004-02-24 Tuesday 21:27  staikos

	* 	merged all diffs from kst_threading_branch

2004-02-24 Tuesday 16:54  staikos

	* 	new branch created since HEAD and kst_threading_branch diverged too far.

	-> Adding new files from the old branch to the new branch

2004-02-24 Tuesday 16:27  staikos

	* 	add implicit recursive locking to the data object derivatives

2004-02-24 Tuesday 00:13  staikos

	* 	reworked yet again

2004-02-23 Monday 16:25  staikos

	* 	completely redesigned locking again.  It deadlocks now but it at least starts
	up and seems to be a bit faster.  Deadlocks should be easy but time consuming
	to work out.

2004-02-23 Monday 01:07  staikos

	* 	Wow that was a dumb bug :)

2004-02-23 Monday 00:23  staikos

	* 	adding read-write lock class

2004-02-22 Sunday 21:49  staikos

	* 	Finally track down a [seemingly longstanding] crash in the plugin dialog when
	showing plugins that were already created.

2004-02-22 Sunday 20:59  staikos

	* 	introduce concept of orphan scalars and use it to make plugin scalar saving
	work properly.

2004-02-18 Wednesday 16:19  staikos

	* 	add tooltips with values of scalars

2004-02-16 Monday 18:27  netterfield

	* 	Fix datamode bug.

2004-02-16 Monday 17:05  staikos

	* 	report usage properly

2004-02-16 Monday 15:54  staikos

	* 	misc fixes discovered today

2004-02-16 Monday 09:22  staikos

	* 	disable the view scalars dialog for now - QTable is way too expensive and
	delays startup time quite a bit.  Let's come up with a different solution.

2004-02-13 Friday 17:26  staikos

	* 	some fixes and a few more tests

2004-02-13 Friday 17:18  staikos

	* 	gcc2.95 compile fix

2004-02-13 Friday 17:18  staikos

	* 	fix floating point scanning bug detected by regression suite

2004-02-13 Friday 17:10  staikos

	* 	- added regression test for equations
	- fixed equation bugs in dcop interface

2004-02-13 Friday 16:56  staikos

	* 	force newer piolib

2004-02-13 Friday 16:53  staikos

	* 	updates for API changes from Claude Mercier.  Compile with old piolib will now
	fail.  Update to piolib-HEAD.

2004-02-13 Friday 16:30  staikos

	* 	nearly forgot: don't leak!

2004-02-13 Friday 16:26  staikos

	* 	don't re-optimize, reparse, etc when it's not necessary.

2004-02-13 Friday 15:04  staikos

	* 	make it compile with newer gcc

2004-02-13 Friday 12:53  staikos

	* 	removed this file

2004-02-13 Friday 12:52  staikos

	* 	activate the new equation parser and interpreter.  It's hooked in
	inefficiently right now, and I have done very little regression testing, but
	it seems to work well enough to start wide testing.  Timings indicate it is,
	finally, requiring approximately 1/4 the amount of CPU time to evaluate the
	same equation as the old one, on average.  Regression tests to follow.

2004-02-13 Friday 06:40  staikos

	* 	missed committing this file

2004-02-13 Friday 06:36  staikos

	* 	implement more equation functionality including constants and powers, and
	start adding optimizations (constant folding so far - quite an improvement
	still!)

2004-02-12 Thursday 12:56  staikos

	* 	- much more work on the interpreter and parser
	- hook in a demo with timings to demonstrate how much faster we are
	- interpret most of the old functions

	result: new code, with function calls, takes 1/3 the amount of CPU time as the
	        old parser.  In the absence of function calls, the differential is much
	        larger yet.  Constant folding and other optimizations could also be of
	        use.

2004-02-12 Thursday 10:52  staikos

	* 	New KstEquation parser that should be many times faster than the current one.
	Still needs a bit of work before it can be plugged into KstEquation.

2004-02-12 Thursday 00:46  staikos

	* 	I just discovered how efficient Qt's XPM loading is

2004-02-11 Wednesday 23:50  staikos

	* 	make this public just in case we want to call it from a script

2004-02-11 Wednesday 23:49  staikos

	* 	create scalars before updating them

2004-02-11 Wednesday 23:45  staikos

	* 	scalars should be updated in these cases

2004-02-11 Wednesday 23:44  staikos

	* 	lots of important performance fixes, update fixes, and crash avoidances

2004-02-11 Wednesday 22:45  staikos

	* 	a bunch of optimizations and a couple of crash fixes

2004-02-11 Wednesday 13:34  staikos

	* 	more unfortunate problems due to the event loop being re-entered
	-> possible workaround would be to disable the update timer during file loads,
	   but file opening is asynchronous too!

2004-02-11 Wednesday 11:17  staikos

	* 	scalar trigger creator dialog

2004-02-11 Wednesday 08:43  staikos

	* 	make vectors accessible from js

2004-02-11 Wednesday 07:43  staikos

	* 	make more sense, less crash

2004-02-11 Wednesday 07:03  staikos

	* 	make it compile with newer piolib

2004-02-10 Tuesday 22:58  staikos

	* 	- make _tag private and fixup accordingly
	- add the beginning of vector and data object bindings for JS
	- mandatory TODO file

2004-02-10 Tuesday 21:45  staikos

	* 	- Set the names of KstObjects so that they're more useful in JS
	- Add a signal to KstScalar::setValue() so that it can be hooked into for
	  the purpose of triggering events on values
	- Add bindings for KstScalars to the js code
	- Add a demo that shows how to execute code when a scalar reaches a certain
	  absolute value
	- Add ability to load scripts from files (action merged with the UI)
	- Merge in the right place

2004-02-10 Tuesday 12:47  staikos

	* 	oops, don't set this if we don't have a complete piolib setup

2004-02-10 Tuesday 12:28  staikos

	* 	This function was removed from piolib.  Let's use a new one

2004-02-10 Tuesday 05:00  staikos

	* 	renamed plancktoi->planckobj and TOI->Object to reflect the new meaning of the
	class, which does all objects, not just TOI ones.  Could probably now remove
	the base class too.

2004-02-10 Tuesday 04:48  staikos

	* 	Added "extension" framework to Kst which allows Kst to make use of optional
	technology not available in the minimum required KDE version.  Added
	KJSEmbed extension, which is only marginally functional right now, and is not
	in the build since it needs an autoconf check still.

2004-02-09 Monday 08:42  staikos

	* 	get rid of all the #ifdefs for piolib

2004-02-09 Monday 01:45  scripty

	* 	Gaussian fitting is now functional, in a framework which is easily extended to other non-linear fits.

2004-01-30 Friday 09:03  netterfield

	* 	Improve datamode - better rules for what 'closest pixel' means.
	Some compiler warning fixes.

2004-01-29 Thursday 20:00  arwalker

	* 	Added

2004-01-29 Thursday 19:59  arwalker

	* 	Added non-linear fits

2004-01-29 Thursday 19:58  arwalker

	* 	Added first of nonlinear fits

2004-01-29 Thursday 19:54  arwalker

	* 	Added nonlinear fits

2004-01-29 Thursday 14:12  arwalker

	* 	Added conditional build for lfiio

2004-01-29 Thursday 14:12  arwalker

	* 	Added conditional build for lfiio datasource

2004-01-29 Thursday 13:10  arwalker

	* 	Added conditional build settings for lfiio datasource

2004-01-29 Thursday 12:48  arwalker

	* 	Modified build settings

2004-01-29 Thursday 12:40  arwalker

	* 	Modified build settings

2004-01-29 Thursday 12:37  arwalker

	* 	Modified to allow for conditional building of gsl dependent plugins

2004-01-29 Thursday 11:50  arwalker

	* 	Added back linear interpolation after adding it to CVS.

2004-01-29 Thursday 11:50  arwalker

	* 	Added linear interpolation

2004-01-29 Thursday 11:47  arwalker

	* 	Removed obsolete file

2004-01-29 Thursday 02:31  staikos

	* 	build fix

2004-01-29 Thursday 01:39  staikos

	* 	revert half the last change.  it was incorrect

2004-01-28 Wednesday 20:47  staikos

	* 	Make updates continue to work after zooming.

2004-01-28 Wednesday 20:26  staikos

	* 	Sometimes I get too focused :)

2004-01-28 Wednesday 20:24  staikos

	* 	only draw points that are inside the plot region

2004-01-28 Wednesday 19:17  arwalker

	* 	Added interpolations

2004-01-28 Wednesday 00:17  staikos

	* 	detabify
	CVS_SILENT

2004-01-28 Wednesday 00:05  staikos

	* 	make updates for derived vectors work with a huge kludge

2004-01-27 Tuesday 23:49  netterfield

	* 	Add getIndexNearX(x) to kstbasecurve, which looks for the index near x.
	If the curve is monotonically rising, it uses a binary search.  Otherwise,
	it uses a linear search.

	Then use this function to re-do dataMode....

	It works - in that it does what I though I wanted it to do...

2004-01-27 Tuesday 23:06  staikos

	* 	return a sensible default label, as the function docs suggest
	-> makes plot labels for filtered slave vectors work

2004-01-27 Tuesday 22:55  staikos

	* 	did tied zoom ever work properly?  This makes it zoom the proper graphs

2004-01-27 Tuesday 22:47  staikos

	* 	properly update the data manager on changes involving slave vectors

2004-01-27 Tuesday 21:55  staikos

	* 	build and install the plugin editor

2004-01-27 Tuesday 21:42  staikos

	* 	add a basically untested autoconf check for gsl.  The fits plugins should
	use the variables set here instead of hardcoding them, and those Makefiles
	should also be updated to reflect that they are plugins and not libraries.

2004-01-27 Tuesday 21:28  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-01-27 Tuesday 21:26  staikos

	* 	- plugins are modules, not libraries
	- fix warnings
	- fix possible crashes in the plugin loader
	- cosmetic changes to the manager
	- load plugins from system directories too, with precedence given to user
	  directories (should add XDG directories later)

2004-01-27 Tuesday 17:51  staikos

	* 	display arguments in the listbox to make it easier to work with

2004-01-27 Tuesday 01:54  staikos

	* 	some polishing

2004-01-27 Tuesday 01:35  staikos

	* 	The new filter parameter editor.  Much nicer, and perhaps I'll reuse this in
	the plugin dialog as well.  It may still need some cosmetic changes

2004-01-26 Monday 21:54  staikos

	* 	Make datamode work on shifted vectors with an absolutely disgusting hack that
	really should be removed ASAP.  SamplesPerFrame should be completely
	encapsulated within the vector and curve I think, but it isn't presently which
	means I need to pass it out via kstbasecurve and use it in kstview.  This
	feels really wrong to me.

	CCMAIL: 72204-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-26 Monday 11:48  staikos

	* 	ifdef, not if

2004-01-23 Friday 15:32  arwalker

	* 	Removed obsolete files.

2004-01-23 Friday 15:30  arwalker

	* 	Removed fits from directory list as it requires gsl 1.4.

2004-01-23 Friday 15:27  arwalker

	* 	Build plugins to $(kde_moduledir)/kstplugins

2004-01-23 Friday 15:00  arwalker

	* 	Compile plugin and corresponding xml file to $(kde_moduledir)/kstplugins

2004-01-22 Thursday 18:47  arwalker

	* 	Added polynomial unweighted fit

2004-01-22 Thursday 18:24  arwalker

	* 	Minor cosmetic changes

2004-01-22 Thursday 18:23  arwalker

	* 	Modified to link to all necessary libraries

2004-01-21 Wednesday 19:53  arwalker

	* 	First draft of polynomial weighted fit

2004-01-21 Wednesday 16:52  arwalker

	* 	Added gradient fits (y=bx).

2004-01-21 Wednesday 16:52  arwalker

	* 	Added gradient weighted fit (y=bx).

2004-01-21 Wednesday 16:51  arwalker

	* 	Added gradient unweighted fit (y=bx).

2004-01-21 Wednesday 15:57  arwalker

	* 	Added residuals to the output arrays

2004-01-21 Wednesday 15:50  arwalker

	* 	Added linear weighted fit

2004-01-20 Tuesday 18:50  arwalker

	* 	Removed the Edit Plots icon associated with several Edit items under the Data menu. These icons serve no purpose and only confuse the user.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 18:29  arwalker

	* 	Ensure that the vector select widgets are updated when a new curve is created through the Quick Curve dialog.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 16:09  arwalker

	* 	Previously if the plugin dialog was open, with plugins installed, but no plugins had been used in the current session then adding a new vector through some other dialog would not result in the vector lists being updated in the plugin dialog. This has now been fixed.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 13:26  arwalker

	* 	Added plugins from 'fits' subdirectory.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 13:25  arwalker

	* 	Added unweighted linear fit

2004-01-20 Tuesday 05:12  staikos

	* 	As the previous implementation wasn't considered "close enough", we now check
	the point rounded up and down (slight bias upward), and use the shortest
	distance instead of the closest Y point.  This is closer to the concept of
	the "closest data point".  It still falls apart with very steep graphs.
	CCMAIL: 72204@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-19 Monday 18:42  arwalker

	* 	Removed obsolete struct's

2004-01-19 Monday 15:53  arwalker

	* 	If the desired plugin does not actually exist then ensure that KST does not crash, but instead alerts the user to the problem.

2004-01-19 Monday 14:38  arwalker

	* 	Removed several compiler warnings

2004-01-17 Saturday 09:20  staikos

	*
	after a marathon session of tuning and tweaking the coordinates, I finally have
	the datamode cursor working.  It isn't pretty and it flickers a little bit, but
	it works.
	CCMAIL: 72206-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-17 Saturday 09:11  adridg

	* 	Fixincludes: need sys/time.h for struct timeval

2004-01-16 Friday 10:15  staikos

	* 	intresting way to get an empty label

2004-01-16 Friday 09:18  staikos

	* 	crash reported here

2004-01-16 Friday 09:17  netterfield

	* 	Command line -g places a legend box
	ascii file reader now recognises (and skips) empty and comment lines
	at begining of files.

2004-01-16 Friday 01:00  staikos

	* 	Add the last of the locks on global list objects, except for plot lists which
	may or may not need them

2004-01-16 Friday 00:37  staikos

	* 	- more locking
	- make the regression tests pass (fix deadlock, infinite loop)

2004-01-15 Thursday 23:56  staikos

	* 	even more locking (vectorlist is complete)

2004-01-15 Thursday 23:06  staikos

	* 	add more locking and repair the indenting mess in kstequationcurve - hopefully
	it will still merge :(

2004-01-15 Thursday 22:35  staikos

	* 	add locking

2004-01-15 Thursday 21:28  staikos

	* 	Make data mode work with vectors that started after 0
	CCMAIL: 72204-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-15 Thursday 20:40  staikos

	* 	Indirect files need to pass the field list through.

	CCMAIL: 72662-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-15 Thursday 19:55  staikos

	* 	send error to cerr since this is effectively a "commandline" error
	also be more verbose

2004-01-15 Thursday 19:42  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2004-01-15 Thursday 19:39  staikos

	* 	what a tricky little bug this was.  Properly update stdin.

2004-01-15 Thursday 02:53  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-01-14 Wednesday 16:12  staikos

	* 	update spec.  thanks for the patch

	CCMAIL: 72661-done@bugs.kde.org

2004-01-13 Tuesday 11:58  netterfield

	* 	A few more UI tweaks:
	-move some stuff around in plotdialog; remove some obsolete wigets
	-fixed but in legend color setting
	-changing legend colors changes sample text as well
	-slightly move default legend location to be clear of the ticks

2004-01-13 Tuesday 01:47  staikos

	* 	Old synchronization patch I had lying around

2004-01-13 Tuesday 01:47  staikos

	* 	CVS committed this to the wrong branch!!

2004-01-13 Tuesday 01:45  staikos

	* 	branch: commit old changes

	HEAD: revert signal to old, deprecated version for compatibility

2004-01-12 Monday 20:36  netterfield

	* 	Some UI Tweaks:
	-Use "settings->Configure Kst" to set colours
	-Add Foreground colour to settings dialog
	-Remove colours from plot dialog
	-Printed plots use same colors as screen.
	-Remove 'update rate' from plot dialog - it is in settings.
	-Make legends use default (system) fonts, as the labels already do
	-Reformat legend options in plot dialog
	-Reorder toolbar so plot-to-file is nearer to print (needs new icon)

2004-01-12 Monday 02:57  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-01-11 Sunday 14:36  arwalker

	* 	Added border to the legend.

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-01-10 Saturday 02:15  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-01-10 Saturday 02:05  arwalker

	* 	Added options for user to place legend in front of plot.
	Added options for foreground and background colors of legend.
	Removed use of KstLabel in legend, as it was used only to
	provide symbol processing, which it no longer does, and
	performance will be better without it.
	Clean up of obsolete code.

2004-01-08 Thursday 22:58  staikos

	* 	Add more synchronization, and track down a -nasty- gcc quirk:

	template<class T>
	class KstObjectList : public QValueList<T>

	1 KstObjectList(const QValueList<T>& x)
	2 KstObjectList(const KstObjectList<T>& x)

	gcc 2.95: Only calls copy constructor #2 (it ignores copy constructors of the
	          first form, which are really a typo anyway)
	gcc 3.3: Calls either one

	Since I had mistyped and used #1, it was crashing in very strange ways on my
	gcc 2.95 machine.  Unfortunately no valgrind there. :-)

2004-01-08 Thursday 22:30  staikos

	* 	One filtered vector point in the list is sufficient.

2004-01-08 Thursday 19:18  netterfield

	* 	Lame looking icon to match the style of all the other lame looking icons...

2004-01-08 Thursday 14:54  arwalker

	* 	Modified formatting to comform with standard...

2004-01-08 Thursday 13:22  staikos

	* 	more synchronization implemented, more thoughts

2004-01-08 Thursday 03:36  mhunter

	* 	CVS_SILENT Typographical corrections and changes

2004-01-08 Thursday 02:19  staikos

	* 	Introduce "Synchronized()" to indicate exclusive paths in the objects instead
	of locking externally.

2004-01-07 Wednesday 23:47  staikos

	* 	enough to demo multithreaded updates with one thread doing the updates.  Not
	sure if we can do better, but at least it's not in the GUI thread anymore.
	It's really horribly thread-unsafe in general though, so doing more than
	loading a file and looking at it is bound to cause crashes, deadlock, or other
	weird problems.

2004-01-07 Wednesday 21:24  staikos

	* 	Just some knotes

2004-01-07 Wednesday 20:14  staikos

	* 	threadsafe shared pointer using semaphore - API-compatible with KShared{Ptr}

	also implemented thread events and started the updating code

2004-01-07 Wednesday 17:41  arwalker

	* 	Added What's This? help to those menu items which were missing it.

2004-01-07 Wednesday 16:57  arwalker

	* 	Added What's This? help to those menu items which were missing it.

2004-01-07 Wednesday 16:38  staikos

	* 	Legend labels shouldn't interpret vector names

2004-01-07 Wednesday 16:22  arwalker

	* 	Added two additional point types, because you can never have enough.

2004-01-07 Wednesday 15:38  arwalker

	* 	Set ShowLegend to false in constructor

2004-01-06 Tuesday 20:33  arwalker

	* 	Added option to display a legend on the canvas of a plot.

2004-01-06 Tuesday 01:50  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-01-02 Friday 21:09  arwalker

	* 	Ensure that while performing a drag/drop operation on a text label that the pixmap is drawn correctly for rotated text.

2004-01-02 Friday 19:38  arwalker

	* 	Provide better positioning of a text label after it has been moved by a drag/drop operation. Also, draw the text properly in the pixmap used during the drag operation, regardless of the text justification used.

2004-01-02 Friday 16:42  arwalker

	* 	Reinstate change that was removed by last commit.

2004-01-01 Thursday 12:52  staikos

	* 	revert whitespace changes

2003-12-31 Wednesday 17:44  arwalker

	* 	As text labels can be rotated it does not make sense to use a simple rectangle to define their bounding region, and this can make it very difficult for a user to select an existing label. We now use a region.

2003-12-31 Wednesday 15:15  arwalker

	* 	Provide better determination of the bounding rect of a text label, by taking into account any superscripts and/or subscripts

2003-12-31 Wednesday 13:41  staikos

	* 	revert whitespace changes.

2003-12-31 Wednesday 13:13  arwalker

	* 	Do not allow the size of the pixmap associated with a text label to be increased in size during a drag operation else a partially uninitialised pixmap will be drawn during the drag. This is only a problem when the size of one of the dimensions of the label is greater than the corresponding screen size.

2003-12-30 Tuesday 03:53  adridg

	* 	Need time.h (explicitly on FBSD) for struct timeval. There's the whole HAVE_SYS_TIME_H thing that ought to be done around the include, but I can't see anyone else doing it in keg-[12].

2003-12-29 Monday 22:01  staikos

	* 	beginning of the threading architecture

2003-12-29 Monday 18:34  arwalker

	* 	Modified behaviour of ^ and _ with symbol (greek) characters

2003-12-29 Monday 17:26  arwalker

	* 	Instead of drawing a label to the screen character by character it is now drawn only with each font attribute (size, emphasis, etc.) change.

2003-12-28 Sunday 08:18  adridg

	* 	Make it compile on Solaris and FreeBSD

2003-12-27 Saturday 11:55  staikos

	* 	several bug fixes and new features including:
	- optimize zooming from O(n) to O(1) time
	- add support for custom background color
	- add a progress dialog to the purge function

2003-12-23 Tuesday 20:48  staikos

	* 	add filter to the menu, enhance the dcop interface (add some filter support)

2003-12-23 Tuesday 00:53  staikos

	* 	Add copy action that copies the current data point to the clipboard (but not
	the selection).  In data mode, it uses the data mode point.  returns
	(NAN,NAN) when there is no current point.  Eventually it should provide a
	native mimetype too.

2003-12-23 Tuesday 00:34  staikos

	* 	Oh dear, did he really try to draw another icon?  Yes, yes he did.  Clearly
	needs to be replaced by someone who knows how to draw.

2003-12-23 Tuesday 00:22  staikos

	* 	- no I was not drunk while I made that last commit.  clearly we already have
	  xpt calculated to much greater accuracy.  duh.
	- add datamode to the toolbar, icon pending

2003-12-23 Tuesday 00:17  staikos

	* 	data mode reverted to old behaviour with minor fixes

	CCMAIL: 68040-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-12-21 Sunday 03:43  staikos

	* 	enable loading and saving of filter sets and filtered vectors

2003-12-21 Sunday 03:21  staikos

	* 	use the new KstScalar method

2003-12-21 Sunday 03:17  staikos

	* 	infrastructure for saving filters - not activated yet

2003-12-21 Sunday 01:30  staikos

	* 	store the file type
	CCMAIL: 70923@bugs.kde.org

2003-12-21 Sunday 01:26  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-12-21 Sunday 01:20  staikos

	* 	rvectors should not crash if they cannot find the file they need.  It's not
	pretty, but I would rather have null files than have files that are useless
	in all ways except that they are not null.  Meanwhile we shouldn't return
	null files for dirfiles that don't exist yet.  That will be fixed next.

	CCMAIL: 70923-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-12-21 Sunday 00:22  staikos

	* 	Make scalars work by name, and make the filter create a scalar with a given
	name if it is specified but it doesn't exist.  This may not be ideal but it's
	the most convenient implementation right now.  For some reason when scalars
	are changed for a plugin, the plugin doesn't update.

2003-12-20 Saturday 22:41  staikos

	* 	We really need a solution for this in designer.  Everytime I commit a .ui file
	I have to remember to edit it by hand first and change 3.2->3.1.

	Also add a missing i18n()

2003-12-20 Saturday 22:33  staikos

	* 	start editting on double click

2003-12-20 Saturday 01:36  staikos

	* 	bug fixes, a small change to the API for filters needed to make them work, and
	add the code to support sets of > 1 filter.

2003-12-20 Saturday 00:10  staikos

	* 	revert last

2003-12-20 Saturday 00:00  staikos

	* 	Make filters work in the case of a filterset with exactly 1 filter defined,
	and only constants for the input scalars.  Fixes to follow, including
	save support.  Also seems that a bug in gcc 3.3-prerelease (suse) was
	tripped by this code, but I was unable to make a good testcase so far.
	Worked around until more can be determined.

2003-12-19 Friday 18:39  arwalker

	* 	Should have checked this in for the original fix.

2003-12-19 Friday 18:16  arwalker

	* 	Redraw the point selection combobox after the dialog
	is initially drawn, so the geometry is correct.

2003-12-19 Friday 17:47  arwalker

	* 	As the histogram will draw lines regardless of the user selection
	we simply disable the option and always select it. This avoids
	potential user confusion.

2003-12-19 Friday 09:17  staikos

	* 	filters are almost functional right now.  just a few small FIXMEs to go...

2003-12-19 Friday 06:29  staikos

	* 	some UI fixes, and make doubleclick in the listbox apply a filter to the
	current filterset

2003-12-19 Friday 06:09  staikos

	* 	- filter UI fixes for the data manager
	- add a context menu to slave^W[insert politically correct term] vectors

2003-12-19 Friday 01:31  scripty

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2003-12-18 Thursday 22:53  staikos

	* 	Remove unneeded checks, repair indenting

2003-12-18 Thursday 21:11  arwalker

	* 	In the Plot Dialog... Labels tab draw the sample labels to
	the correct size, before the user makes some change to them.

	* 	CVS_SILENT made messages

2003-12-17 Wednesday 23:09  netterfield

	* 	Make it compile...

2003-12-17 Wednesday 20:08  arwalker

	* 	For better user interface consistency use the
	curveAppearance widget in the Quick Curve
	and Quick PSD dialogs

2003-12-17 Wednesday 18:02  arwalker

	* 	Provide a marginally nicer looking appearance of the point style
	drawn in the edit field portion of the combobox by centering the
	point style and painting the entire area in the same colour.

2003-12-16 Tuesday 20:10  arwalker

	* 	Do not modify the selected point style when the user selects a new colour.

2003-12-16 Tuesday 20:09  arwalker

	* 	Added triangular data point style

2003-12-16 Tuesday 18:07  arwalker

	* 	Removed compiler warnings

2003-12-16 Tuesday 17:52  arwalker

	* 	Do not call DataFileEntry->setEnabled( false ) in update( ... ) when we have
	valid vectors as the user may have checked the SourceDataFile option,
	in which case the DataFileEntry should be enabled.

2003-12-15 Monday 20:48  staikos

	* 	add the filtered vectors to the data manager, update the dialogs

2003-12-15 Monday 19:21  arwalker

	* 	Added chop plugin to build

2003-12-12 Friday 17:55  arwalker

	* 	Added plugin to chop data. This is useful when, for example, alternating data points are actually chopped from reference to sky.

2003-12-12 Friday 17:23  staikos

	* 	much more of the UI fixed and activated, but it still needs very much work

2003-12-12 Friday 16:45  arwalker

	* 	Added several new plugins to the build

2003-12-12 Friday 14:47  staikos

	* 	lots of GUI fixes and enhancements, and some minor filter fixes

2003-12-12 Friday 01:37  staikos

	* 	committing initial filter files (incomplete)

2003-12-07 Sunday 17:23  staikos

	* 	draw the last point in graphs.  I'm not sure if this is entirely correct, but
	it definitely fixes this bug.  The problem is that there might be unexpected
	consequences, so this needs lots of testing before release.

	CCMAIL: 69645-done@bugs.kde.org

	-fix ref-counting bugs for command line objects:
		???Ptr were used for some temporary variables which don't go
		out of scope before app.exec(), so the reference stays forever.
		One could
			i) make sure they go out of scope
			ii) make sure they are set to zero before app.exec
			iii) use ???* instead of ???Ptr for temporary variables.

	data sources (fragmenting).

2003-11-04 Tuesday 19:06  staikos

	* 	update the spec file for the plugins, add the stub for the reload action

2003-11-04 Tuesday 01:15  staikos

2003-10-22 Wednesday 20:55  staikos

2003-10-22 Wednesday 20:37  staikos

	* 	merging the planckio branch and creating the framework for the planck plugin

2003-10-22 Wednesday 19:12  staikos

	* 	- Implement indirect datasource as a plugin which contains another datasource!
	- merge some more of kstfile - including dirfile and frame file detection
	- remove unused methods
	- make isValid() virtual for the indirect datasource plugin

2003-10-22 Wednesday 16:47  staikos

	* 	- move the data code into the proper plugins
	- add the frame plugin, untested and not yet functional by any means

2003-10-21 Tuesday 22:32  staikos

	* 	- get rid of C++ compatibility headers, they're not needed now
	- fix dirfile plugin build and enable it - it certainly doesn't work yet
	though.

2003-10-21 Tuesday 22:08  staikos

	* 	- pushed some functionality from the plugins up into the base class
	- added the beginning (uncompilable) of the dirfile plugin

2003-10-21 Tuesday 21:06  staikos

	* 	Nothing wrong with an empty file - it could get data later if it's generated
	in realtime

2003-10-21 Tuesday 20:00  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT remove unneeded debug and update changelog

2003-10-21 Tuesday 19:43  staikos

	* 	Activated the new plugin code.  kstfile is now obsolete.

	NOTE: Only ascii files work now, and I would prefer to write that as "work".
	      The demo loads and seems to be minimally functional.  There is still
	      much work left to do though.  Other plugins will be reimplemented over
	      time.  If you need stable Kst, please update from the kst_0_93_release
	      tag.

	* 	*finally* straighten out the log-log graph coordinates in data mode.  I think
	this is the last data mode bug to fix before 0.93

2003-10-20 Monday 04:56  staikos

	* 	- Only display data in data mode when we are actually inside a graph
	- Init some variables
	- Point out optimization points in the curve and vector code

2003-10-17 Friday 03:56  staikos

	* 	tab order fixes

2003-10-17 Friday 03:34  staikos

2003-10-17 Friday 03:29  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-10-17 Friday 03:23  staikos

	* 	- install the datasource header and its dependencies
	- note in those classes about binary compatibility
	- move KstObject implementations out of the header file
	- add virtual_hooks
	- add d-pointers
	- create datasource plugin template
	- create ascii plugin that is completely non-functional right now

	Plugins may change quite a bit still

2003-10-17 Friday 02:40  staikos

	* 	let's query the opposite way

2003-10-17 Friday 02:23  staikos

	* 	more datasource code implemented

2003-10-17 Friday 00:10  staikos

	* 	started the abstract data source object

2003-10-16 Thursday 22:53  staikos

	* 	minor changes - mostly whitespace and dead code removal - from planck branch
	primarily

2003-10-16 Thursday 22:25  staikos

	* 	fix crash issues, apparently introduce another small bug

2003-10-10 Friday 06:20  staikos

	* 	non-planck compile fix

2003-10-10 Friday 06:08  staikos

	* 	Finally finish basic piolib TOI integration.  it's really not pretty, but it's
	very basically functional (and slow).  Many problems with Kst design were
	discovered that need to be addressed if we want to do a proper piolib
	integration.  (It's fine for what it is, but it wasn't designed to do what
	piolib wants to do.)  Also several API and documentation bugs were discovered
	in PIOLib, as well as some design inefficiencies that we should try to address.

2003-10-10 Friday 03:36  staikos

	* 	crash fix

2003-10-10 Friday 03:29  staikos

	* 	tool to generate sample PLANCK TOI data based on the C document example

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:19  staikos

	* 	more minor fixes or hacks

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:09  staikos

	* 	apply crash fix from the branch into HEAD

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:07  staikos

	* 	some planck fixes and a crash fix for nonexistent files

2003-10-09 Thursday 13:30  staikos

	* 	make it clear which version we are referring to

2003-10-09 Thursday 13:28  staikos

	* 	integrate libpio and enable planckio builds.  also workaround some pio flaws.

2003-10-09 Thursday 01:44  staikos

	* 	new idea: let piolib handle type conversion and bail out, this way we don't
	have to do string compares and we can support a large number of conversions

2003-10-09 Thursday 01:24  staikos

	* 	more implementation, some fixes, and some cleanup

2003-10-09 Thursday 00:54  staikos

	* 	A big chunk of PIOLib integration - TOI only so far, and completely untested
	as the piolib linking is not done yet.  Code compiles without PIOLib still.

2003-10-03 Friday 04:26  staikos

	* 	decrease instantiation time of KstApp::KstApp by 20%

2003-10-03 Friday 00:46  staikos

	* 	statistical optimisations in the ascii file reading code - check the common
	case before the uncommon case.

2003-10-02 Thursday 21:31  staikos

	* 	huge improvements in drawing performance - extremely noticeable.  drawing should
	now be about 7 times faster.  I can still improve this by a factor of 4 or so
	from where it is now by rewriting this code altogether.

	other slow points are documented.

2003-10-02 Thursday 20:14  staikos

	* 	get rid of unnecessary isnan() calls.  cachegrind seems to indicate that they
	are at least as expensive as floor() and we call it too often (hundreds of
	thousands of times)

2003-10-02 Thursday 17:59  staikos

	* 	PSD optimizations: store iterators or pointers to avoid extra lookups.  Should
	reduce cpu time on some inner loops by as much as 78% according to cachegrind!

2003-10-02 Thursday 06:55  staikos

	* 	Early results from profiling:
	- cache the label width where possible to avoid recalculation (very expensive)
	- don't update dialogs that aren't shown()
	- cache the font families

2003-10-02 Thursday 05:20  staikos

	* 	more enabled/disabled fixes

2003-10-02 Thursday 03:14  staikos

	* 	fix datamanager button synchronization

2003-10-02 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	* 	Allow the removal of error bars

	CCMAIL: 65340-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-10-02 Thursday 01:02  staikos

	* 	This was the result of a misguided patch.  Unfortunately KstMouse will make it
	overly complicated to add more mouse modes in the future due to its concept of
	"plotNum".  It might be a good idea to store more stateful information, and
	actually have the plotNum reflect the plot it's actually in.  I think this
	could simplify KstView somewhat too.  Anyways, something to think about for the
	future.

	CCMAIL: 65278-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-30 Tuesday 19:57  staikos

	* 	can't use a fixed widget here with datamode anymore.  this now flickers but
	ideally we can fix this later with a more custom widget.

2003-09-29 Monday 21:17  staikos

	* 	Implement the rest of #64894.  There is still room for improvement (right now
	it only handles integral x coordinates, it's probably not the most efficient,
	etc), but it works.

	CCMAIL: 64894-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-29 Monday 17:07  staikos

	* 	Add support for most of #64894.  It's not functional, but this removes much of
	the code duplication in kstview and adds a stub "data mode" to be filled in
	later.  Might require some minor semantic changes to kstbasecurve and/or kstplot.

	CCMAIL: 64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-27 Saturday 18:41  staikos

	* 	Most of the implementation require for this feature.  Requires more design in
	order to complete.

	CCMAIL: 64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-26 Friday 19:22  staikos

	* 	Ah this could be the reason.  Does this patch help?

	CCMAIL: 64977@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 Thursday 17:49  netterfield

	* 	Fix Bug 64890 - Zoomed graphs give wrong mouse data

	Add a new (experimental) autoscale mode: spike insensitive autoscale
	During a balloon flight, the telemtered data often has spikes and dropouts.
	I have added an autoscale mode which ignores points near unusually large
	transients.  kstvector calculates the limits, ns_min and ns_max.
	It seems to work very well on archived data.

2003-09-25 Thursday 16:29  staikos

	* 	more notes

2003-09-25 Thursday 15:55  staikos

	* 	Fix the KstFile disappearance.

	Also update the data manager and other dialogs when changes are made directly
	on the plot.

2003-09-25 Thursday 13:26  staikos

	wants it.

	CCMAIL: 64892-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-24 Wednesday 20:53  staikos

	* 	Changes default rate from 60.0 Hz -> 100 Hz

	Thanks for the fix.

	CCMAIL: 64888-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-24 Wednesday 14:06  staikos

	* 	open 0.93 development and remove a spurious semicolon

2003-09-24 Wednesday 13:59  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT bump version and retag

2003-09-24 Wednesday 00:18  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT warning--

2003-09-22 Monday 22:49  staikos

	* 	proposal for changes to Kst to support PIOLib and other similar systems in
	the future

2003-09-22 Monday 00:53  staikos

	* 	Add an option to clean up the layout.

	CCMAIL: 64686@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-21 Sunday 17:02  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-09-21 Sunday 16:52  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-09-21 Sunday 16:45  staikos

	* 	wow this was tricky to find.  Update the plot number in the mouse class so that
	the proper labels are searched in label mode.  This might need to be expanded
	but I haven't triggered such bugs elsewhere yet.

2003-09-21 Sunday 07:52  netterfield

	* 	bugfix for d2asc

2003-09-20 Saturday 16:20  staikos

	* 	This isn't necessary

2003-09-20 Saturday 16:06  staikos

	* 	Add "Edit Curve" to the context menu to quickly edit a curve in a plot.

	Fix some minor label mode bugs.

2003-09-20 Saturday 15:39  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT spelling fixes

2003-09-20 Saturday 15:11  staikos

	*
	context menu reorganised.  it's not so overwhelming now, and shortforms were
	all expanded (Prev->Previous, etc)

2003-09-20 Saturday 14:14  netterfield

	* 	Plot dialog needs to be updated after the plot is selected...
	(related to "Plot/Label selection bug)

2003-09-20 Saturday 14:04  staikos

	* 	Make the plot label dialog work properly and some minor cleanups

2003-09-20 Saturday 11:04  netterfield

	* 	Fixed "Exiting Bug"

2003-09-20 Saturday 10:03  netterfield

	* 	Add License and copyright stuff to the c files

2003-09-20 Saturday 09:34  netterfield

	* 	Vector field name autocompletion in vector dialog and quick curves dialog
	(only works for dirfile files.  Ascii files it doesn't make sense - just
	a collumn number, and readdata files are obsolete, and no longer to be
	updated)

2003-09-20 Saturday 02:46  staikos

	* 	various bugfixes for labels, the view, and mouse handling

	enhance the context menu to allow the user to easily add and remove curves and
	delete plots

2003-09-17 Wednesday 21:31  staikos

	* 	fixlets and exposing a function for use in datapush

2003-09-17 Wednesday 16:36  staikos

	* 	minor bug fix

2003-09-15 Monday 21:40  staikos

	* 	fix various label drag issues as discussed on the list, including:

	- labels may only be dragged in label mode
	- labels may be editted and deleted again

2003-09-15 Monday 12:51  netterfield

	* 	Common Case speedup: redraw of large vectors after zooming

2003-09-12 Friday 18:54  staikos

	* 	fix painting and add a small fudge factor to get the label to fall in the
	"exact" right place without any offset

2003-09-12 Friday 18:00  staikos

	* 	minor glitch fixes and polishing for label drags

	drags now work quite well I think

2003-09-12 Friday 17:49  staikos

	* 	hotspot changes as discussed - labels now drag from the point selected and drop
	exactly where they appear to be dropping.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:37  staikos

	* 	eliminate the garbage in the drag pixmap.  Unfortunately it still doesn't paint
	into the pixmap properly so we get a blank pixmap, or a pixmap with tiny
	writing in it now.  Will have to debug this later.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:24  staikos

	* 	cleanups, and fix drag initiation detection.

	Drag is re-enabled in non-label mode to see how the interaction is (and see if
	it should be left in or reverted).  It seems to work well for me but it may or
	may not be unexpected/interfere with zooming.  It is however convenient.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:53  staikos

	* 	only allow label drags in label mode for now.  proper drag start should be
	added later to avoid the problem of zoombox initiating a drag.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:47  staikos

	* 	draggable labels - basically works, but still a bit buggy

	problems:
	 - the drag pixmap gets corrupted somehow
	 - dragging to other plots causes the extents to be temporarily broken
	 - the pixmap is centred around the hotspot, but drawn (top,left) at the
	   hotspot after the drop.  (which should we change?)

2003-09-11 Thursday 19:10  staikos

	* 	A whackload of minor/insignificant cleanups, and make the label dialog clear
	out the entry field when creating new labels in order to distinguish from the
	case where the user clicked on an existing label in order to edit it.  This is
	particularily important for cases where the user clicks close to an existing
	label but accidentally misses it.

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	* 	put a title on the context menu

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:17  staikos

	* 	Shift and Ctrl should not override label mode

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:07  staikos

	* 	Lots of code cleanup, and make the mouse pointer an arrow over labels (the
	existing code was incorrect)

2003-09-11 Thursday 17:13  staikos

	* 	Add the rest of the context menu stuff requested in the TODO

2003-09-11 Thursday 15:04  staikos

	* 	Create the context menu requested in the TODO file.  Added "Edit" and "Delete"
	so far.  Still need to add the more advanced items.

2003-09-01 Monday 09:41  staikos

	* 	revert last.  kst must compile with 3.1 also.

2003-09-01 Monday 09:09  tokoe

	* 	Make use of XDG

2003-08-25 Monday 18:26  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT speling and i18n style guide fixes

2003-08-17 Sunday 09:10  mlaurent

	* 	Allow to change shortcut

2003-08-13 Wednesday 17:14  staikos

	* 	misc cleanups while preparing for file field detection

2003-08-13 Wednesday 03:02  staikos

	* 	parser for the format file, and return a list of all the filenames

2003-08-13 Wednesday 02:34  staikos

	* 	heavy reworkings:
	- make the socket reusable
	- make the connection state two phased:
		- first phase is control and setup
		- second phase is passive pull mode
	- "go" triggers a move from phase one to phase two
	- "format" in phase one dumps the format file
	- prepare to parse the format file

2003-08-12 Tuesday 18:42  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-08-12 Tuesday 18:39  staikos

	* 	- Makefile for datapushd
	- Hack for printing empty files to circumvent KDE/Qt problems
	- TODO update
	- Compile fixlets for datapushd

2003-08-12 Tuesday 04:21  staikos

	* 	some bugfixes and a quite command

2003-08-12 Tuesday 04:04  staikos

	* 	the server portion of the code to monitor a datafile and push changes over the
	lan

2003-08-11 Monday 12:24  mueller

	* 	fix compilation

2003-08-10 Sunday 21:34  staikos

	* 	don't wipe out the entry fields if the plugin manager is opened

2003-08-10 Sunday 20:45  staikos

	* 	more GUI cleanups

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:52  staikos

	* 	UI enhancements (part 1)

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:38  staikos

	* 	Convert vectors to using a map.  It's still not what I would consider 'clean'
	because we don't use this everywhere yet.  Infact, there are cases that still
	using private members instead of the input lists for their vectors.
	This is purely for performance reasons.  There is no harm now because we don't
	even use the input lists for anything externally, but we might in the future.
	For now, all is good.

	Also fixes some crashes I stumbled across.  More uncovered bug fixes to follow.

2003-08-08 Friday 16:01  staikos

	* 	after a marathon regression testing, valgrinding, and debugging, I think I can
	safely say that the list->map conversion of scalar inputs and outputs works and
	vector conversion can be done too.

2003-08-07 Thursday 15:22  staikos

	* 	remove scalarlist.h - not needed

2003-08-07 Thursday 14:52  staikos

	* 	- fix a memory corruption problem in main due to double delete of the mainwindow
	in some cases

	- only update the necessary parts of the data manager.  this is implemented in a
	rather slow way (the code is ~O(n^2)) but it is more reliable for now.  In the
	future we should tell the datamanager what to do, as opposed to telling it to
	update and having it determine what needs to be updated.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 21:33  staikos

	* 	by default, zero memory on resize().  uses memset() for now, but an alternative
	method is also provided.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	* 	We decided that this is the proper output for the test.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:18  staikos

	* 	notes about what remains CVS_SILENT

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:04  staikos

	* 	Plenty of updates to the test suite.  Now generates plots and output.  Fixed
	a couple of minor bugs from before, and added option -v to specify to run Kst
	inside valgrind.

	Latest results:
	  - valgrind clean except for UMRs when accessing unset data inside vectors
	    (not so bad, still not sure what to do)
	  - printing empty plots fails (KPrinter mode)

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:57  staikos

	* 	fix another crash found by regression tests, and implement printing images and
	postscript from dcop.  Seems to have trouble with printing empty plots in
	postscript, though printing empty plots to images works.  Could indicate a bug
	in the printing code.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:10  staikos

	* 	fix testcases 169,170,172,174 and put in a compiled-out solution idea for
	testcases 190,191

2003-07-29 Tuesday 21:54  staikos

	* 	a regression test script for Kst.  So far it seems to trigger approximately
	half a dozen bugs.

2003-07-29 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	* 	traced down a UMR, and a nasty bug that was resulting in complex crashes:
	main() is far too complex.  It should do much less, or be refactored.  The
	problem is that there are too many codepaths, and KstApp* was not being
	deleted, resulting in kstdoc not being deleted, resulting in the global lists
	being nonempty (and the static destruction trying to empty them, of course in
	the wrong order!).

	(this was found with the new regression testing scripts)

2003-07-27 Sunday 09:18  mueller

	* 	compile (gcc 3.4+)

2003-07-25 Friday 22:58  netterfield

	* 	Fix minor math error

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:37  staikos

	* 	add ability to create vector curves, and fix plot creation slightly (it's still
	a bit broken in that the newly created plots seem to take over the screen until
	the plotlist is manipulated again.  will track this down later.)

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:02  staikos

	* 	plot manipulation functions exposed to dcop.  can create, delete, list, and list
	contents of plots.  can also add and remove curves.  extended plot manipulation
	is still missing.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 12:30  staikos

	* 	vector manipulation dcop interface, and scalar creation support

2003-07-22 Tuesday 11:58  staikos

	* 	many new dcop methods added, and scalars can now be set by assignment of a
	double.  It's now possible to generate equation plots of all sorts with dcop,
	manipulate scalars, generate vectors, list vectors, list objects, list scalars,
	list inputs and outputs, save vectors, and more!

2003-07-21 Monday 14:07  staikos

	* 	vector saving is complete, including progress dialog and error messages

2003-07-18 Friday 18:32  staikos

	* 	Allow vectors to be saved to disk.  UI doesn't keep sync with the vector list
	at all times yet (needs at least one fix still), and there is no error reporting
	in the saving code yet.  Also might switch the vector saving code to use
	QTextStream instead of snprintf+write.

2003-07-18 Friday 16:34  staikos

	* 	bump version number to indicate post 0.91, add code for saving vectors (unused).
	Also fill in the about data some.

2003-07-17 Thursday 19:38  staikos

	* 	spec file fixes

2003-07-17 Thursday 18:43  staikos

	* 	notes about how to make a Kst release (packaging)

2003-07-17 Thursday 18:10  staikos

	* 	bump version number CVS_SILENT

2003-07-17 Thursday 12:28  netterfield

	* 	Possibly reduce non noac nsf mounted dirfile concurrency pathologies

2003-07-17 Thursday 11:15  staikos

	* 	make sure all objects are updated (equations, plugins especially)

2003-07-16 Wednesday 19:47  staikos

	* 	untested spec file for kst, also updated the lsm a bit

2003-07-16 Wednesday 09:17  netterfield

	* 	Pause updates while mouse zooming
	deleted obsolete static
	Should be ready for 0.90 'release'.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 21:34  netterfield

	* 	Stick with ~clean interpolation with bounds checking.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:17  staikos

	* 	don't jump around in the dialogs when an update(-1) is triggered.  this is a bit
	of a hack, but it works flawlessly so far and it's safer than changing the logic
	of update() everywhere.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:05  staikos

	* 	drop the references before updating the plot dialog

2003-07-15 Tuesday 18:46  staikos

	* 	minor cleanups in the plot dialog, and put some assert()s and remove some
	unneeded stuff in kstvector::interpolate

2003-07-15 Tuesday 17:08  staikos

	* 	fix the ref counting in the plot dialog

2003-07-15 Tuesday 16:58  netterfield

	* 	Use local variables for math in kstvector::update.
	84% cpu to 30% cpu in one benchmark....

2003-07-15 Tuesday 16:31  staikos

	* 	refcounting fixes, and disable delete in the dialogs when it is not usable.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 15:44  staikos

	* 	don't access elements of the list that don't exist

2003-07-15 Tuesday 15:21  staikos

	* 	- fix equations which were rather broken
	- fix a c&p copyright that was never editted

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:54  netterfield

	* 	Adjustable update delay in the plot dialog.  Is saved
	in kst file as well.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:20  staikos

	* 	- remove some unused stuff from kstequationcurve
	- make kstvector explicitly ref count to be safe

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:10  staikos

	*
	switch to using a QDict for scalars, and make sure they are cleaned up when the
	parent vector is done with them.  Unfortunately QDict<KSharedPtr<foo> > doesn't
	seem to work too well so this may not last.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 12:00  netterfield

	* 	CPU usage bug in kstrvector fixed
	rework menues

2003-07-15 Tuesday 10:40  staikos

	* 	various minor bugfixes, as well as making scalars and vectors use the same
	namespace.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 09:19  staikos

	* 	The final ref counting bugs that I could find.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 08:43  staikos

	* 	more cleanups, vector removal works

2003-07-15 Tuesday 08:13  staikos

	* 	store data object names

2003-07-14 Monday 21:03  staikos

	* 	some cleanups, comments, and movements

2003-07-14 Monday 20:44  staikos

	* 	-very- close to perfect ref counting (and thus working purging) now.  the only
	remaining problem is that the data manager doesn't display the ref count for
	vectors quite correctly.

2003-07-14 Monday 20:40  staikos

	* 	almost there - only a few extra references are hanging around now!

2003-07-14 Monday 20:08  staikos

	* 	- repair the previous commit
	- remove more stored curve lists.  the hide() trick doesn't work for obvious
	  reasons

2003-07-14 Monday 19:47  staikos

	* 	clean some sprintf()

2003-07-14 Monday 19:35  staikos

	* 	some ref counting fixes, with purge of objects enabled.  still more to be done.

2003-07-14 Monday 18:48  staikos

	* 	- plot dialog doesn't need to keep the curve list around
	- update the data manager last
	- don't access the empty combobox in the curve placement widget

2003-07-14 Monday 12:00  netterfield

	* 	Vector and Rvector work
		-fixed interpolation bugs
		-only the first sample in the last frame is read to make
			interplation with coarser vectors make sense
		-refactored some stuff in RVector - use Vector methods more

2003-07-11 Friday 14:09  staikos

	* 	cleanup some unused stuff

2003-07-11 Friday 14:00  staikos

	* 	port data vectors to the new listview, and clean up after a visit from the
	const police

2003-07-11 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	deleting some types of objects works now
	(those ones also have proper usage counts)

2003-07-11 Friday 03:44  staikos

	* 	Kst provides its own palette now, and use KPalette in kstcolorsequence.

2003-07-11 Friday 03:02  staikos

	* 	palette file with the Kst colours

2003-07-10 Thursday 20:20  netterfield

	* 	psd's use output vectors instead of locally allocated arrays
	output vectors now work from psd's
	fixed 1 off bug in kstvector::interpolate()

2003-07-10 Thursday 05:43  staikos

	* 	some work towards getting the usage counts back in sync

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:53  staikos

	* 	- usage note for kstplugin
	- only activate Edit and Delete buttons when they're meaningful

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:41  staikos

	* 	lots of cleanup, bug fixing, and error handling.  This stuff can now handle
	all kinds of crazy errors like invalid input files, and recover with as much
	information as possible.  For instance, it's now possible to load a plugin with
	invalid input or no output vectors defined and it will notify the user, mark
	the plugin, and wait for it to be repaired.

2003-07-09 Wednesday 14:22  staikos

	* 	lazy load input vectors

2003-07-09 Wednesday 08:50  netterfield

	* 	Fix modality bug in label dialog
	Fix compilation bugs with --enable-final

2003-07-07 Monday 17:51  staikos

	* 	add licence and copyright (as best as could be determined)

	Barth: you might want to change the years on some of these if you care about
	       that.  I just put a generic copyright in place for now.

2003-07-07 Monday 17:27  staikos

	* 	fix bug: error bars were inverted - set none, it tries to use *end().  set one
	  and it wipes out your setting

	add license and copyright

2003-07-07 Monday 16:58  staikos

	* 	- use a static deleter
	- convert the rest of the color stuff that I could find to use KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:36  staikos

	* 	convert to KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:27  staikos

	* 	re-add the color changer.  Could use some enhancement by the artistically
	endowed.  Right now it has the old color list and uses those, along with the
	QColor::dark() versions of those colors.

2003-07-07 Monday 15:01  staikos

	* 	allow Escape to break out of a zoom

2003-07-07 Monday 14:41  netterfield

	* 	Fix bug in psd's
	some progress on real time dirfile vector reading...
		dirfiles are separate files for each field.  They may not
		appear sycronously over NFS unless mounted -o noac.

2003-07-07 Monday 14:07  staikos

	* 	just return garbage instead of crashing

2003-07-07 Monday 13:42  staikos

	* 	explain to the user why we are about to crash with an absolutely baffling
	backtrace

2003-07-07 Monday 11:57  staikos

	* 	urgh this stuff is just too inconsistent in kdelibs :(

	Let's be explicit and manually do what we want in each case.

2003-07-07 Monday 09:50  netterfield

	* 	Usable arbitrary labels (need UI feedback now)
	Fixed vector problems:
		-changing rvector ranges now works
		-fixed sigma and rms scalars

2003-07-07 Monday 03:36  staikos

	* 	workaround for kmainwindow problem

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:53  staikos

	* 	slightly improve the hack and apply it to the statusbar too

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:13  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT warn--

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:10  staikos

	*
	keep the toolbar action status in sync when restoring with session management.

	Is this a kdelibs bug?  It seems to me that this should be automatic.

2003-07-05 Saturday 16:41  netterfield

	* 	Label saving, use scalarwidget in labeldialog.

2003-07-04 Friday 20:51  staikos

	* 	don't crash

2003-07-04 Friday 12:34  netterfield

	* 	added Saving/loading arbitrary labels.

2003-07-04 Friday 11:53  netterfield

	* 	More work on labels:
		-label editing works
		-mouse cursor indicates when you are over an editable label

2003-07-03 Thursday 18:55  staikos

	* 	an example of lazy loading input vectors

2003-07-03 Thursday 17:59  staikos

	* 	cleanup loads of warnings

2003-07-03 Thursday 09:26  staikos

	* 	fix connection

2003-06-29 Sunday 17:22  sleiber

	* 	Fix text

2003-06-29 Sunday 16:31  mlaurent

	* 	";;" -> ";"

2003-06-28 Saturday 12:15  sleiber

	* 	add a caption to the printingdialog

2003-06-28 Saturday 10:07  netterfield

	* 	label selection in process...

2003-06-28 Saturday 07:29  mueller

	* 	speling fixes

2003-06-27 Friday 13:54  staikos

	* 	compile with kdelibs 3.1.x

2003-06-27 Friday 02:29  staikos

	* 	setEnabled/Disabled cleanups

2003-06-27 Friday 02:24  staikos

	* 	KIO enable image saving

2003-06-27 Friday 01:28  staikos

	* 	completely rework the graphics file dialog.  Uses KURLRequester now, supports
	KImageIO, and is far less code in general.  Still needs to be KIO enabled.

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:04  staikos

	* 	graphics.ui is unused, and fix the layouts on graphfiledialog a bit

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:00  staikos

	* 	- use scalarselector in eqdialog, and fix a small bug in scalar selector
	- allow doubleclick in the data manager to bring up the editor dialog

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:48  staikos

	* 	Make sure Apply Edits is the default button on the dialogs.  Also get vector
	lists with <None> working in the vector selector.  Works in the curve dialog
	now.

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:30  staikos

	* 	leak fixes, and add <None> vector to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:47  staikos

	* 	layout fix for plugin dialog, as well as a bug fix.  minor fixes to the scalar
	selector, including a double validator.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:29  staikos

	* 	add the scalar selector, which uses the scalar editor.  Integrate it with the
	plugin dialog to start.  Also bugfixes in the plugin dialog, and in the vector
	selector.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:46  staikos

	* 	The rest of the data manager dialogs use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:23  staikos

	* 	Use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:08  staikos

	* 	switch to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 17:40  staikos

	* 	Add the vector selector widget, along with implementing it in the equation
	dialog.  Seems quite useful so far.
	Also cleanup the vector dialog a bit.
	Also fix that annoying bug where it wouldn't display on startup.  Unfortunately
	it's nothing more than a hack, really.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 15:39  staikos

	* 	a scalar editor dialog for creating custom scalars.  presently unused.  the idea
	is to go from comboboxes or lineedits to actually having a kstvectorselector
	and a kstscalarselector, with a creator button where applicable.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 11:37  staikos

	* 	copy in the backup file code

2003-06-25 Wednesday 09:33  staikos

	* 	not in 3.1 I guess

2003-06-25 Wednesday 00:29  staikos

	* 	remove some code that has lost its usefulness

2003-06-25 Wednesday 00:25  staikos

	* 	vector dialog now uses globalInstance().  Reconnect it to hs, psd and curve
	dialogs as it was before.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 23:49  staikos

	* 	A whole bunch of refactoring.  DataObjects now have a showDialog() method
	which if implemented will show the proper dialog for that object.  KstApp no
	long needs to store eq/plugin/hs/psd/curve dialogs.  Others may follow.  There
	is also no need to do type identification on the object to determine which
	dialog to show it in.

	Dialogs now may emit "modified" to update kstdoc.

	Pointer to KstDoc in dialogs is now deprecated, and hopefully will be fully
	eliminated in the future.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 21:28  staikos

	* 	- clean up our slave vectors and scalars when data objects are deleted.
	- clean up KstFiles when RVectors are removed
	- start to add Purge code, but it doesn't seem to work right.  I think there are
	  still stale references to objects around.  At least it won't crash now, but
	  cleaning up just doesn't work right yet.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 20:43  staikos

	* 	1) I somehow reverted my fix, so restore it: must add to existing plots before
	   adding new ones otherwise the combobox gets desynced.
	2) rework the plugin handling a bit - should work better now
	3) don't allow vectors/scalars to be created with existing labels
	4) vectors/scalars created with blank tag get one automatically assigned.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 16:03  staikos

	* 	HOWTO write plugins

2003-06-24 Tuesday 15:29  staikos

	* 	revert a small part of the last patch, and add backup file support

2003-06-24 Tuesday 15:18  staikos

	* 	session management works now

2003-06-23 Monday 17:25  staikos

	* 	make it clear that there is no typo

2003-06-22 Sunday 15:15  mueller

	* 	speling fixes

2003-06-21 Saturday 16:31  deller

	* 	some cleanups and roaming user fixes: use readPathEntry/writePathEntry instead of readEntry/writeEntry where necessary

2003-06-21 Saturday 00:21  netterfield

	* 	Removed doc dependency from dialogs - use signals.
	Fix hang bug in quick psd dialog
	Fix nan/infinity bug in kstvector.

2003-06-20 Friday 18:52  staikos

	* 	beginnings of session code, not done though.

2003-06-20 Friday 16:14  staikos

	* 	Let kmainwindow store the toolbar/size/etc settings for us

2003-06-20 Friday 14:54  staikos

	* 	factor out more addPlot() code

2003-06-20 Friday 14:41  staikos

	* 	wipe out another copy of addPlot()

2003-06-20 Friday 14:37  staikos

	* 	enable placement in psds, and refactor addPlot as well as make it more
	generally useful and robust

2003-06-20 Friday 13:49  staikos

	* 	moc doesn't like variables in the slots section

2003-06-20 Friday 13:47  staikos

	* 	bye bye quick equations.  they can now be done from the equation dialog, or
	via dcop.

	Also added a routine to create vectors via dcop.  However it makes regular
	vectors which are therefore orphans.  If we decide that this is useful, I guess
	we should make a governor/owner for these things.  In any case, it's useful
	for testing purposes right now.

2003-06-20 Friday 13:32  staikos

	* 	set correct values for the vector's scalars

2003-06-20 Friday 13:17  staikos

	* 	make eqdialog have a curve placement widget and use it.  refactor a bit, with
	much more to come.  a bit more dialog cleanup in place also.  Unfortunately
	there is a bug in eqdialog that makes the plot not use the proper coordinates
	to display with when creating a new plot.  I'll have to try to track this
	down later.

	kstvector now has a method to generate a vector - this didn't belong in
	kstequationcurve.

2003-06-20 Friday 10:11  netterfield

	* 	Limited functionality Arbitrary lables. (Not editable)
	Bug fix in kstplotdialog_i
	some signal re-working

2003-06-20 Friday 01:49  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-06-20 Friday 01:48  staikos

	* 	- add a demo dcop interface.  has methods to list the scalars, list the vectors,
	create an equation plot (basic, slightly incomplete, but usable), and show the
	data manager dialog

	- add a method to kstobjectlist to generate a list of the tagnames

	- notes on refactoring

	-

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:45  staikos

	* 	more conversion to curveplacementwidget

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:18  staikos

	* 	factor out the curve placement code.  Not much gained in terms of lines of code,
	but the ability to change things centrally is nice, and the api is cleansed a
	bit too.

2003-06-19 Thursday 21:32  staikos

	* 	more conversions to the new curve appearance widget, and add more features to it

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT for designer

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	* 	convert to using the new factored out widget

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:36  staikos

	* 	the first refactoring in the dialogs.  This one pulls out curveappearance and
	makes it a separate widget.  It is implemented presently using a "Custom
	Widget" in designer.

	The equation dialog was also enhanced with some setEnabled(bool) connections
	to disable things that can't be used, a horizontal rule, some rearranging, etc

2003-06-17 Tuesday 21:32  staikos

	* 	some cleanup and bug fixes, get rid of null vectors (does this break rvector
	at all? I would think that it does, but I can't see anything broken), and
	put an explicit show() on the view after loading a document to make sure it
	paints.

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:24  staikos

	* 	fix memory corruption

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:02  staikos

	* 	file saving and loading is mostly repaired, along with some memory corruption
	in kstplot.

2003-06-15 Sunday 12:58  staikos

	* 	switch to using NaN for NOPOINT

2003-06-13 Friday 22:21  netterfield

	* 	Better label dialog
	Fixed auto labels

2003-06-13 Friday 19:20  netterfield

	* 	minor cleanups:
	  -remove commented out code
	  -remove unused variable

2003-06-13 Friday 19:15  netterfield

	* 	Fixed scalar substitution in labels.
	Labels now use the KST::scalarList global.
	The scalar list no longer needs to be passed through kstplot.

2003-06-13 Friday 18:49  netterfield

	* 	Fix to symbol font in kstlabels

2003-06-13 Friday 17:02  staikos

	* 	updates from the meeting today

2003-06-13 Friday 09:52  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:50  netterfield

	* 	Adding kstlabeldialog*
	The dialog needs work (to make an understatement...)

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:36  staikos

	* 	not needed

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:26  netterfield

	* 	First steps in adding arbitrarily placable labels....
	Reworked KstMouse in KstView
	Added action

2003-06-12 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	* 	scatter some typenames throughout to make gcc3 happy

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:48  staikos

	* 	add an isNull accessor here, if kstrvector is going to make it null.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:34  staikos

	* 	More of the refactoring done.  slave vectors are history, and shared pointers
	are used almost everywhere now.  Only curves and plots are unshared.  Many
	potential bugs were fixed, and memory doesn't seem to leak, though I haven't
	checked the "reachables" yet according to valgrind.  There are no other
	memory errors to my knowledge.  The only remaining problems are that "Purge"
	doesn't work yet.  This is related to usage count being broken.  There is
	still plenty of cleanup to do, including removing unused variables and member
	variables, unused methods, and some renaming.  There is also some logic that
	can be removed now because it duplicates existing logic.

	The lists that were once in kstdoc are now in a KST:: namespace and global
	in order to facilitate linking purposes and ease of use.  Now scalars and
	vectors add themselves to the global lists automatically.

	Full diff is ~4600 lines.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:22  staikos

	* 	it helps to use the new variable

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:19  staikos

	* 	another access beyond the end of the array while interpolating.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:10  staikos

	* 	don't access beyond the end of the array when scaling

2003-06-10 Tuesday 14:19  staikos

	* 	more cleanup, remove some debug, convert to typedefs instead of big template
	expressions, etc.

2003-06-10 Tuesday 12:50  staikos

	* 	remove some debug, add a compile fix for the new RESTORE() macro

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:08  staikos

	* 	some cleanup

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:03  staikos

	* 	KstFile is now a KstObject.  Needs more work, but everything is functional
	it seems, except perhaps purging.

2003-06-09 Monday 19:36  staikos

	* 	The next big round of changes - no more *vector*list classes anymore.  This is
	basically as functional as before, but quick(psd|equation|*) may not quite
	work right at the moment.  This is easily fixed later.

	There are two known memory errors which will go away as KstFile becomes a
	shared object, and as the Vector classes are reworked for the final time.
	They don't appear to cause much of a problem right now.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 01:42  staikos

	* 	First major portion of the cleanup - refactor into KstDataObjects, not counting
	KstFile.  Vectors are not changed.  This removes all kinds of code duplication
	though much still remains.  Some things are still not ideal but they're
	getting closer.  It is quite likely that this patch broke things, but the very
	basics still seem to work fine.

	Removes 1000-1500 lines of code.

2003-06-02 Monday 20:08  staikos

	* 	more reworking of the classes - dataObjectList is now used in kstdoc, though
	the curves are still separate

2003-06-02 Monday 15:35  staikos

	* 	add debug temporarily to track usage

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:12  staikos

	* 	count()->length() for the vector

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:11  staikos

	* 	Some of the changes to the vectors are started.  I'm doing these incrementally,
	and periodically somethings may break.  For instance, vector usage counts
	probably do not work right now, though they will work again once the changes
	are complete.  This change mostly changes method names, adds some new ones,
	removes some that need to disappear, etc.  The next change will likely be
	the use of KSharedPtr<> instead of the raw pointer (which will -mostly- fix
	the usage count again).  There are probably memory leaks right now.

2003-06-01 Sunday 17:20  staikos

	* 	more cleanup

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:44  staikos

	* 	cleanups

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:30  staikos

	* 	- kstscalarlist.cpp is no longer needed
	- fix a bug in kstcurvedialog where it didn't plot in an existing plot AND
	  in a separate plot

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:25  staikos

	* 	Most finish the Scalar conversion to the new object model.  Seems to have
	cleaned up many memory issues, as well as removed lots of code!  There is
	still much more code to remove or change to using iterators too.

2003-05-28 Wednesday 17:19  staikos

	* 	compile fixes

2003-05-28 Wednesday 17:16  staikos

	* 	updates

2003-05-28 Wednesday 16:27  staikos

	* 	add the realloced methods

2003-05-28 Wednesday 16:12  staikos

	* 	First step in refactoring:
	- move functions defined in the UML diagram up into parent classes
	- redo the inheritence (mostly done)
	- other minor cleanups

2003-05-28 Wednesday 14:28  staikos

	* 	init the variable

2003-05-26 Monday 17:49  staikos

	* 	updates from the meeting

2003-05-26 Monday 11:21  netterfield

	* 	Changes to kstview: better qpixmap handling.

2003-05-25 Sunday 15:02  staikos

	* 	misc cleanups

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:53  staikos

	* 	no use passing around static data

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:40  staikos

	* 	add samples for these two base classes.  kstdataobject was not touched because
	it is in use already, but it's the next one to integrate.

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:23  staikos

	* 	this should not be in CVS

2003-05-25 Sunday 13:04  staikos

	* 	slight layout adjustments and resize the font for non-2560x1024 screens :)

2003-05-25 Sunday 12:01  staikos

	* 	remove the second METASOURCES line that was commented out anyways.

2003-05-25 Sunday 09:54  mlaurent

	* 	Use KCmdLineLastOption

2003-05-24 Saturday 20:48  staikos

	* 	version 0.89, update copyrights

2003-05-23 Friday 22:10  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-05-23 Friday 21:52  staikos

	* 	interpolate X as needed - not well tested, but seems to work

2003-05-23 Friday 20:32  staikos

	* 	spelling fix Lable->Label

2003-05-23 Friday 17:51  staikos

	* 	plugin loading and saving - as much as can be done

2003-05-23 Friday 17:22  staikos

	* 	edit works as advertised now, updating the data manager properly.

2003-05-23 Friday 17:15  staikos

	* 	edit fixes, still not fully working.  Data manager gets confused.

2003-05-23 Friday 16:48  staikos

	* 	clean up vectors when new plugin fails

2003-05-23 Friday 16:15  staikos

	* 	- avoid a crash by leaking memory until we can fix the architecture properly
	- detect errors when trying to create a new plugin

2003-05-23 Friday 15:53  staikos

	* 	switch to using a lineedit for outputs

2003-05-23 Friday 15:09  staikos

	* 	pass in a, b, chi^2 as scalars

2003-05-23 Friday 14:38  staikos

	* 	typo => wrong results

2003-05-23 Friday 14:17  staikos

	* 	oops

2003-05-23 Friday 13:46  staikos

	* 	compiling with warning is better than erroring

2003-05-23 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-05-23 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	line fitting plugin example

2003-05-22 Thursday 21:43  staikos

	* 	update - more information, slight refactoring

2003-05-22 Thursday 20:58  staikos

	* 	UML for the redesigned data object hierarchy

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:50  staikos

	* 	compilation fixes

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:25  netterfield

	* 	Made kstvector a kstdataobject
		this breaks d2asc compiles, but kst is still OK: Help
	Made doc->scalarList a static member of kstvector, so that kstvectors
		can insert their scalars into the list.

	I think it would be better to add doc->scalarList to KstScalar
		and doc->vectorList as static member of KstVector so things
		can insert and delete themselves!

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:17  staikos

	* 	don't double delete

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:07  staikos

	* 	Fix vector leaks

2003-05-22 Thursday 18:58  staikos

	* 	plugin editting works, more crashes removed

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:52  staikos

	* 	make the dialog show the correct combobox values in edit mode.

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:23  staikos

	* 	Lots of plugin work.  Unfortunately the vector architecture is becoming a real
	problem now.  I had to put in lots of hacks that could go away if we make all
	vectors the same (or specialised) as discussed.  I think this has to happen
	sooner rather than later.

	The vector list classes need to be reworked too.

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:39  staikos

	* 	fix scalar parsing in the XML and add widget spacing to the generated dialog

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:28  staikos

	* 	a demo with scalars

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:13  staikos

	* 	This didn't work in HEAD for some reason, but worked in branch.  This patch
	ensures it works everywhere.

2003-05-22 Thursday 02:26  staikos

	* 	pass in the input vectors to the plugin

2003-05-22 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	* 	show the associated vectors, increment their usage, etc

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:39  staikos

	* 	update the plugins to reflect the new memory scheme

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:35  staikos

	* 	call the plugins

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:26  staikos

	* 	- change the default action in plugin dialog from delete to save
	- make kstdataobject KShared because eventually all dataobjects will be
	  KShared probably.
	- return const QString& from accessor in kstdataobject
	- note about vector and scalar lists moving into kstdataobject eventually

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:01  staikos

	* 	- fix a bug in plugins since the change to KstDataObject
	- make the plugin code generate unique names like the other objects
	- add plugins to the data manager window (without the vectors currently)

2003-05-21 Wednesday 21:57  staikos

	* 	move "Loaded" over one column.  It looks better to select the plugin name, not
	it's loaded state pixmap.

2003-05-21 Wednesday 14:35  netterfield

	* 	Fix update bug:
		call update on all dependancies liberally
		call update on all slaves
		use a counter to avoid re-updates
		note: recursion is not detected, will produce junk results, but
			should not crash

2003-05-20 Tuesday 09:35  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT while you're at it, might as well make this "cannot" then.

2003-05-20 Tuesday 04:19  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT i18n style guide fixes

2003-05-16 Friday 11:28  staikos

	* 	for now, just don't crash until the code is complete

2003-05-16 Friday 04:21  staikos

	* 	work on calling the plugin.  slightly incomplete pending discussion on
	memory management

2003-05-16 Friday 03:36  staikos

	* 	lots of bug fixes

2003-05-16 Friday 02:36  staikos

	* 	add another deep and meaningful plugin for testing

2003-05-16 Friday 02:33  staikos

	* 	- missed a constructor initialisation
	- add debug statements to show that refcounting is working

2003-05-16 Friday 02:22  staikos

	* 	make it do what the xml file says it does

2003-05-16 Friday 02:14  staikos

	* 	new, edit, delete of plugins works, though not all fields are saved yet.

2003-05-16 Friday 00:01  staikos

	* 	saving new plugins and deleting old ones now works partially

2003-05-15 Thursday 23:39  staikos

	* 	more plugin implementation

2003-05-15 Thursday 23:07  staikos

	* 	more plugin work.  starting to integrate them into the app.

	Using KSharedPtr<> instead of homebrew ref counting.

2003-05-15 Thursday 22:45  staikos

	* 	some thoughts

2003-05-15 Thursday 21:14  staikos

	* 	- fix plugin removal
	- minor UI fix

2003-05-15 Thursday 20:47  staikos

	* 	add some input and output that doesn't come close to matching the plugin yet :)

2003-05-15 Thursday 19:39  staikos

	* 	fill in the scalar and vector lists

2003-05-15 Thursday 18:00  staikos

	* 	The UI generator for plugins.  Parameters are not done.

2003-05-15 Thursday 16:03  staikos

	* 	rename

2003-05-15 Thursday 13:56  staikos

	* 	restore some of this code

2003-05-14 Wednesday 12:35  staikos

	* 	switch kstxml->xml

2003-05-14 Wednesday 11:26  netterfield

	* 	Rework of KstFile:
		Use QFile (where possible) and KTempFile
		Bug fix (massive speedup) in reading data from stdin
	removed some warnings from readdata

2003-05-14 Wednesday 01:17  staikos

2003-05-07 Wednesday 19:15  staikos

	* 	Convert all the forms:

	const SomePrimitiveType& parameter

	to just

2003-05-07 Wednesday 18:18  staikos

	* 	- some i18n fixes
	- get rid of unnecessary casts
	- don't cast (QString)"foo".  Use QString("foo") if really needed, or better,
	  rework it so it can be i18n("")
	- (float)foo -> float(foo) etc
	- const bool& is a bad idea and does nothing of benefit over bool.

	* 	more const/inheritence cleanup

2003-05-07 Wednesday 17:44  staikos

2003-05-07 Wednesday 16:29  staikos

	work.

	fixes, inheritence fixes, and more.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 14:36  staikos

2003-05-07 Wednesday 04:50  coolo

2003-05-06 Tuesday 17:59  staikos
