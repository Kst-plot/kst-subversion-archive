- save and load state
- object browser GUI
- better console
- multiple consoles?
- multiple interpreters?
- dump list of loaded files
- clear interpreter
- bindings to more objects
- ability to create plugins/filters
- ability to create vectors/scalars <-- only via plugins?
- KSharedPtr support
- bridge to the dcop interface
- many bindings lack good [or any] bindings (ComboBox, list{view,box}, etc)
- no way to xmlgui merge (need a client basically)
- need a standard way to create bindings that won't conflict
