---------------------------
Bugs:

Zooming in too far blows up the graphing algorithm, causes plotting of
effective singularities and does weird things with the axis drawing.

--------------------------
Wishlist:

Better Kst Help

Functions:
  Special Functions
    De-spike
    Coadd
    RaDec
    Convolve/Deconvolve
    Fitting

Move the graphing engine into a separate library

Write files out with QDom instead of a text stream
 - it may be slower, but it allows much more powerful manipulation.

---------------------------
Cleanup:

- use signals instead of asking KstDoc to do everything
- make naming schemes consistent
- cleanup main()
- cleanup kstdoc and kstapp to make things more modular
