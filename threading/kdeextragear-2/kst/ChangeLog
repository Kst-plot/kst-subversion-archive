2003-12-21 Sunday 01:20  staikos

	* 	rvectors should not crash if they cannot find the file they need.  It's not
	pretty, but I would rather have null files than have files that are useless
	in all ways except that they are not null.  Meanwhile we shouldn't return
	null files for dirfiles that don't exist yet.  That will be fixed next.

	CCMAIL: 70923-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-12-21 Sunday 00:22  staikos

	* 	Make scalars work by name, and make the filter create a scalar with a given
	name if it is specified but it doesn't exist.  This may not be ideal but it's
	the most convenient implementation right now.  For some reason when scalars
	are changed for a plugin, the plugin doesn't update.

2003-12-20 Saturday 22:41  staikos

	* 	We really need a solution for this in designer.  Everytime I commit a .ui file
	I have to remember to edit it by hand first and change 3.2->3.1.

	Also add a missing i18n()

2003-12-20 Saturday 22:33  staikos

	* 	start editting on double click

2003-12-20 Saturday 01:36  staikos

	* 	bug fixes, a small change to the API for filters needed to make them work, and
	add the code to support sets of > 1 filter.

2003-12-20 Saturday 00:10  staikos

	* 	revert last

2003-12-20 Saturday 00:00  staikos

	* 	Make filters work in the case of a filterset with exactly 1 filter defined,
	and only constants for the input scalars.  Fixes to follow, including
	save support.  Also seems that a bug in gcc 3.3-prerelease (suse) was
	tripped by this code, but I was unable to make a good testcase so far.
	Worked around until more can be determined.

2003-12-19 Friday 18:39  arwalker

	* 	Should have checked this in for the original fix.

2003-12-19 Friday 18:16  arwalker

	* 	Redraw the point selection combobox after the dialog
	is initially drawn, so the geometry is correct.

2003-12-19 Friday 17:47  arwalker

	* 	As the histogram will draw lines regardless of the user selection
	we simply disable the option and always select it. This avoids
	potential user confusion.

2003-12-19 Friday 09:17  staikos

	* 	filters are almost functional right now.  just a few small FIXMEs to go...

2003-12-19 Friday 06:29  staikos

	* 	some UI fixes, and make doubleclick in the listbox apply a filter to the
	current filterset

2003-12-19 Friday 06:09  staikos

	* 	- filter UI fixes for the data manager

2003-12-17 Wednesday 18:02  arwalker

	* 	Provide a marginally nicer looking appearance of the point style
	drawn in the edit field portion of the combobox by centering the
	point style and painting the entire area in the same colour.

2003-12-16 Tuesday 20:10  arwalker

	* 	Do not modify the selected point style when the user selects a new colour.

	in which case the DataFileEntry should be enabled.

2003-12-12 Friday 17:55  arwalker

	* 	Added plugin to chop data. This is useful when, for example, alternating data points are actually chopped from reference to sky.

2003-12-12 Friday 17:23  staikos

	* 	much more of the UI fixed and activated, but it still needs very much work

2003-12-12 Friday 16:45  arwalker

2003-10-22 Wednesday 19:12  staikos

	* 	- Implement indirect datasource as a plugin which contains another datasource!
	- merge some more of kstfile - including dirfile and frame file detection
	- remove unused methods
	- make isValid() virtual for the indirect datasource plugin

2003-10-22 Wednesday 16:47  staikos

	* 	- move the data code into the proper plugins
	- add the frame plugin, untested and not yet functional by any means

2003-10-21 Tuesday 22:32  staikos

	* 	- get rid of C++ compatibility headers, they're not needed now
	- fix dirfile plugin build and enable it - it certainly doesn't work yet
	though.

2003-10-21 Tuesday 22:08  staikos

	* 	- pushed some functionality from the plugins up into the base class
	- added the beginning (uncompilable) of the dirfile plugin

2003-10-21 Tuesday 21:06  staikos

	* 	Nothing wrong with an empty file - it could get data later if it's generated

2003-10-21 Tuesday 20:00  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT remove unneeded debug and update changelog

2003-10-21 Tuesday 19:43  staikos

	* 	Activated the new plugin code.  kstfile is now obsolete.

	NOTE: Only ascii files work now, and I would prefer to write that as "work".
	      The demo loads and seems to be minimally functional.  There is still
	      much work left to do though.  Other plugins will be reimplemented over
	      time.  If you need stable Kst, please update from the kst_0_93_release

2003-10-20 Monday 04:56  staikos

2003-10-10 Friday 06:20  staikos

2003-10-10 Friday 06:08  staikos

	* 	Finally finish basic piolib TOI integration.  it's really not pretty, but it's
	very basically functional (and slow).  Many problems with Kst design were
	discovered that need to be addressed if we want to do a proper piolib
	integration.  (It's fine for what it is, but it wasn't designed to do what
	piolib wants to do.)  Also several API and documentation bugs were discovered
	in PIOLib, as well as some design inefficiencies that we should try to address.

2003-10-10 Friday 03:36  staikos

	* 	tool to generate sample PLANCK TOI data based on the C document example

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:19  staikos

	* 	more minor fixes or hacks

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:09  staikos

	* 	apply crash fix from the branch into HEAD

2003-10-09 Thursday 23:07  staikos

	* 	some planck fixes and a crash fix for nonexistent files

2003-10-09 Thursday 13:30  staikos

	* 	make it clear which version we are referring to

2003-10-09 Thursday 13:28  staikos

	* 	integrate libpio and enable planckio builds.  also workaround some pio flaws.

2003-10-09 Thursday 01:44  staikos

	* 	new idea: let piolib handle type conversion and bail out, this way we don't
	have to do string compares and we can support a large number of conversions

2003-10-09 Thursday 01:24  staikos

	* 	more implementation, some fixes, and some cleanup

2003-10-09 Thursday 00:54  staikos

	* 	A big chunk of PIOLib integration - TOI only so far, and completely untested
	as the piolib linking is not done yet.  Code compiles without PIOLib still.

2003-10-03 Friday 04:26  staikos

	* 	decrease instantiation time of KstApp::KstApp by 20%

2003-10-03 Friday 00:46  staikos

	* 	statistical optimisations in the ascii file reading code - check the common
	case before the uncommon case.

2003-10-02 Thursday 21:31  staikos

	* 	huge improvements in drawing performance - extremely noticeable.  drawing should
	now be about 7 times faster.  I can still improve this by a factor of 4 or so
	from where it is now by rewriting this code altogether.

	other slow points are documented.

2003-10-02 Thursday 20:14  staikos

	* 	get rid of unnecessary isnan() calls.  cachegrind seems to indicate that they
	are at least as expensive as floor() and we call it too often (hundreds of
	thousands of times)

2003-10-02 Thursday 17:59  staikos

	* 	PSD optimizations: store iterators or pointers to avoid extra lookups.  Should
	reduce cpu time on some inner loops by as much as 78% according to cachegrind!

2003-10-02 Thursday 06:55  staikos

	* 	Early results from profiling:
	- cache the label width where possible to avoid recalculation (very expensive)
	- don't update dialogs that aren't shown()
	- cache the font families

2003-10-02 Thursday 05:20  staikos

	* 	more enabled/disabled fixes

2003-10-02 Thursday 03:14  staikos

	* 	fix datamanager button synchronization

2003-10-02 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	* 	Allow the removal of error bars

	CCMAIL: 65340-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-10-02 Thursday 01:02  staikos

	* 	This was the result of a misguided patch.  Unfortunately KstMouse will make it
	overly complicated to add more mouse modes in the future due to its concept of
	"plotNum".  It might be a good idea to store more stateful information, and
	actually have the plotNum reflect the plot it's actually in.  I think this
	could simplify KstView somewhat too.  Anyways, something to think about for the
	future.

	CCMAIL: 65278-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-30 Tuesday 19:57  staikos

	* 	can't use a fixed widget here with datamode anymore.  this now flickers but
	ideally we can fix this later with a more custom widget.

2003-09-29 Monday 21:17  staikos

	* 	Implement the rest of #64894.  There is still room for improvement (right now
	it only handles integral x coordinates, it's probably not the most efficient,
	etc), but it works.

	CCMAIL: 64894-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-29 Monday 17:07  staikos

	* 	Add support for most of #64894.  It's not functional, but this removes much of
	the code duplication in kstview and adds a stub "data mode" to be filled in
	later.  Might require some minor semantic changes to kstbasecurve and/or kstplot.

	CCMAIL: 64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-27 Saturday 18:41  staikos

	* 	Most of the implementation require for this feature.  Requires more design in
	order to complete.

	CCMAIL: 64894@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-26 Friday 19:22  staikos

	* 	On second thought, better be safe.

2003-09-26 Friday 19:21  staikos

	* 	This seems to update the mouse properly.
	CCMAIL: 64891-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-26 Friday 18:33  staikos

	* 	Simple script to generate data in real time for testing

2003-09-26 Friday 09:40  staikos

	* 	Ah this could be the reason.  Does this patch help?

	CCMAIL: 64977@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 Thursday 17:49  netterfield

	* 	Fix Bug 64890 - Zoomed graphs give wrong mouse data

	Add a new (experimental) autoscale mode: spike insensitive autoscale
	During a balloon flight, the telemtered data often has spikes and dropouts.
	I have added an autoscale mode which ignores points near unusually large
	transients.  kstvector calculates the limits, ns_min and ns_max.
	It seems to work very well on archived data.

2003-09-25 Thursday 16:29  staikos

	* 	more notes

2003-09-25 Thursday 15:55  staikos

	* 	Fix the KstFile disappearance.

	Also update the data manager and other dialogs when changes are made directly
	on the plot.

2003-09-25 Thursday 13:26  staikos

	* 	lrint() not portable enough.  rint() should be sufficient here anyways.

	CCMAIL: 64926-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-25 Thursday 04:54  staikos

	* 	I can't find an argument either way for this, so let's select all if the user
	wants it.

	CCMAIL: 64892-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-24 Wednesday 20:53  staikos

	* 	Changes default rate from 60.0 Hz -> 100 Hz

	Thanks for the fix.

	CCMAIL: 64888-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-24 Wednesday 14:06  staikos

	* 	open 0.93 development and remove a spurious semicolon

2003-09-24 Wednesday 13:59  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT bump version and retag

2003-09-24 Wednesday 00:18  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT warning--

2003-09-22 Monday 22:49  staikos

	* 	proposal for changes to Kst to support PIOLib and other similar systems in
	the future

2003-09-22 Monday 00:53  staikos

	* 	Add an option to clean up the layout.

	CCMAIL: 64686@bugs.kde.org

2003-09-21 Sunday 17:02  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-09-21 Sunday 16:52  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-09-21 Sunday 16:45  staikos

	* 	wow this was tricky to find.  Update the plot number in the mouse class so that
	the proper labels are searched in label mode.  This might need to be expanded
	but I haven't triggered such bugs elsewhere yet.

2003-09-21 Sunday 07:52  netterfield

	* 	bugfix for d2asc

2003-09-20 Saturday 16:20  staikos

	* 	This isn't necessary

2003-09-20 Saturday 16:06  staikos

	* 	Add "Edit Curve" to the context menu to quickly edit a curve in a plot.

	Fix some minor label mode bugs.

2003-09-20 Saturday 15:39  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT spelling fixes

2003-09-20 Saturday 15:11  staikos

	*
	context menu reorganised.  it's not so overwhelming now, and shortforms were
	all expanded (Prev->Previous, etc)

2003-09-20 Saturday 14:14  netterfield

	* 	Plot dialog needs to be updated after the plot is selected...
	(related to "Plot/Label selection bug)

2003-09-20 Saturday 14:04  staikos

	* 	Make the plot label dialog work properly and some minor cleanups

2003-09-20 Saturday 11:04  netterfield

	* 	Fixed "Exiting Bug"

2003-09-20 Saturday 10:03  netterfield

	* 	Add License and copyright stuff to the c files

2003-09-20 Saturday 09:34  netterfield

	* 	Vector field name autocompletion in vector dialog and quick curves dialog
	(only works for dirfile files.  Ascii files it doesn't make sense - just
	a collumn number, and readdata files are obsolete, and no longer to be
	updated)

2003-09-20 Saturday 02:46  staikos

	* 	various bugfixes for labels, the view, and mouse handling

	enhance the context menu to allow the user to easily add and remove curves and
	delete plots

2003-09-17 Wednesday 21:31  staikos

	* 	fixlets and exposing a function for use in datapush

2003-09-17 Wednesday 16:36  staikos

	* 	minor bug fix

2003-09-15 Monday 21:40  staikos

	* 	fix various label drag issues as discussed on the list, including:

	- labels may only be dragged in label mode
	- labels may be editted and deleted again

2003-09-15 Monday 12:51  netterfield

	* 	Common Case speedup: redraw of large vectors after zooming

2003-09-12 Friday 18:54  staikos

	* 	fix painting and add a small fudge factor to get the label to fall in the
	"exact" right place without any offset

2003-09-12 Friday 18:00  staikos

	* 	minor glitch fixes and polishing for label drags

	drags now work quite well I think

2003-09-12 Friday 17:49  staikos

	* 	hotspot changes as discussed - labels now drag from the point selected and drop
	exactly where they appear to be dropping.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:37  staikos

	* 	eliminate the garbage in the drag pixmap.  Unfortunately it still doesn't paint
	into the pixmap properly so we get a blank pixmap, or a pixmap with tiny
	writing in it now.  Will have to debug this later.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:24  staikos

	* 	cleanups, and fix drag initiation detection.

	Drag is re-enabled in non-label mode to see how the interaction is (and see if
	it should be left in or reverted).  It seems to work well for me but it may or
	may not be unexpected/interfere with zooming.  It is however convenient.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:53  staikos

	* 	only allow label drags in label mode for now.  proper drag start should be
	added later to avoid the problem of zoombox initiating a drag.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:47  staikos

	* 	draggable labels - basically works, but still a bit buggy

	problems:
	 - the drag pixmap gets corrupted somehow
	 - dragging to other plots causes the extents to be temporarily broken
	 - the pixmap is centred around the hotspot, but drawn (top,left) at the
	   hotspot after the drop.  (which should we change?)

2003-09-11 Thursday 19:10  staikos

	* 	A whackload of minor/insignificant cleanups, and make the label dialog clear
	out the entry field when creating new labels in order to distinguish from the
	case where the user clicked on an existing label in order to edit it.  This is
	particularily important for cases where the user clicks close to an existing
	label but accidentally misses it.

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	* 	put a title on the context menu

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:17  staikos

	* 	Shift and Ctrl should not override label mode

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:07  staikos

	* 	Lots of code cleanup, and make the mouse pointer an arrow over labels (the
	existing code was incorrect)

2003-09-11 Thursday 17:13  staikos

	* 	Add the rest of the context menu stuff requested in the TODO

2003-09-11 Thursday 15:04  staikos

	* 	Create the context menu requested in the TODO file.  Added "Edit" and "Delete"
	so far.  Still need to add the more advanced items.

2003-09-01 Monday 09:41  staikos

	* 	revert last.  kst must compile with 3.1 also.

2003-09-01 Monday 09:09  tokoe

	* 	Make use of XDG

2003-08-25 Monday 18:26  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT speling and i18n style guide fixes

2003-08-17 Sunday 09:10  mlaurent

	* 	Allow to change shortcut

2003-08-13 Wednesday 17:14  staikos

	* 	misc cleanups while preparing for file field detection

2003-08-13 Wednesday 03:02  staikos

	* 	parser for the format file, and return a list of all the filenames

2003-08-13 Wednesday 02:34  staikos

	* 	heavy reworkings:
	- make the socket reusable
	- make the connection state two phased:
		- first phase is control and setup
		- second phase is passive pull mode
	- "go" triggers a move from phase one to phase two
	- "format" in phase one dumps the format file
	- prepare to parse the format file

2003-08-12 Tuesday 18:42  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-08-12 Tuesday 18:39  staikos

	* 	- Makefile for datapushd
	- Hack for printing empty files to circumvent KDE/Qt problems
	- TODO update
	- Compile fixlets for datapushd

2003-08-12 Tuesday 04:21  staikos

	* 	some bugfixes and a quite command

2003-08-12 Tuesday 04:04  staikos

	* 	the server portion of the code to monitor a datafile and push changes over the
	lan

2003-08-11 Monday 12:24  mueller

	* 	fix compilation

2003-08-10 Sunday 21:34  staikos

	* 	don't wipe out the entry fields if the plugin manager is opened

2003-08-10 Sunday 20:45  staikos

	* 	more GUI cleanups

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:52  staikos

	* 	UI enhancements (part 1)

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:38  staikos

	* 	Convert vectors to using a map.  It's still not what I would consider 'clean'
	because we don't use this everywhere yet.  Infact, there are cases that still
	using private members instead of the input lists for their vectors.
	This is purely for performance reasons.  There is no harm now because we don't
	even use the input lists for anything externally, but we might in the future.
	For now, all is good.

	Also fixes some crashes I stumbled across.  More uncovered bug fixes to follow.

2003-08-08 Friday 16:01  staikos

	* 	after a marathon regression testing, valgrinding, and debugging, I think I can
	safely say that the list->map conversion of scalar inputs and outputs works and
	vector conversion can be done too.

2003-08-07 Thursday 15:22  staikos

	* 	remove scalarlist.h - not needed

2003-08-07 Thursday 14:52  staikos

	* 	- fix a memory corruption problem in main due to double delete of the mainwindow
	in some cases

	- only update the necessary parts of the data manager.  this is implemented in a
	rather slow way (the code is ~O(n^2)) but it is more reliable for now.  In the
	future we should tell the datamanager what to do, as opposed to telling it to
	update and having it determine what needs to be updated.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 21:33  staikos

	* 	by default, zero memory on resize().  uses memset() for now, but an alternative
	method is also provided.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	* 	We decided that this is the proper output for the test.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:18  staikos

	* 	notes about what remains CVS_SILENT

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:04  staikos

	* 	Plenty of updates to the test suite.  Now generates plots and output.  Fixed
	a couple of minor bugs from before, and added option -v to specify to run Kst
	inside valgrind.

	Latest results:
	  - valgrind clean except for UMRs when accessing unset data inside vectors
	    (not so bad, still not sure what to do)
	  - printing empty plots fails (KPrinter mode)

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:57  staikos

	* 	fix another crash found by regression tests, and implement printing images and
	postscript from dcop.  Seems to have trouble with printing empty plots in
	postscript, though printing empty plots to images works.  Could indicate a bug
	in the printing code.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:10  staikos

	* 	fix testcases 169,170,172,174 and put in a compiled-out solution idea for
	testcases 190,191

2003-07-29 Tuesday 21:54  staikos

	* 	a regression test script for Kst.  So far it seems to trigger approximately
	half a dozen bugs.

2003-07-29 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	* 	traced down a UMR, and a nasty bug that was resulting in complex crashes:
	main() is far too complex.  It should do much less, or be refactored.  The
	problem is that there are too many codepaths, and KstApp* was not being
	deleted, resulting in kstdoc not being deleted, resulting in the global lists
	being nonempty (and the static destruction trying to empty them, of course in
	the wrong order!).

	(this was found with the new regression testing scripts)

2003-07-27 Sunday 09:18  mueller

	* 	compile (gcc 3.4+)

2003-07-25 Friday 22:58  netterfield

	* 	Fix minor math error

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:37  staikos

	* 	add ability to create vector curves, and fix plot creation slightly (it's still
	a bit broken in that the newly created plots seem to take over the screen until
	the plotlist is manipulated again.  will track this down later.)

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:02  staikos

	* 	plot manipulation functions exposed to dcop.  can create, delete, list, and list
	contents of plots.  can also add and remove curves.  extended plot manipulation
	is still missing.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 12:30  staikos

	* 	vector manipulation dcop interface, and scalar creation support

2003-07-22 Tuesday 11:58  staikos

	* 	many new dcop methods added, and scalars can now be set by assignment of a
	double.  It's now possible to generate equation plots of all sorts with dcop,
	manipulate scalars, generate vectors, list vectors, list objects, list scalars,
	list inputs and outputs, save vectors, and more!

2003-07-21 Monday 14:07  staikos

	* 	vector saving is complete, including progress dialog and error messages

2003-07-18 Friday 18:32  staikos

	* 	Allow vectors to be saved to disk.  UI doesn't keep sync with the vector list
	at all times yet (needs at least one fix still), and there is no error reporting
	in the saving code yet.  Also might switch the vector saving code to use
	QTextStream instead of snprintf+write.

2003-07-18 Friday 16:34  staikos

	* 	bump version number to indicate post 0.91, add code for saving vectors (unused).
	Also fill in the about data some.

2003-07-17 Thursday 19:38  staikos

	* 	spec file fixes

2003-07-17 Thursday 18:43  staikos

	* 	notes about how to make a Kst release (packaging)

2003-07-17 Thursday 18:10  staikos

	* 	bump version number CVS_SILENT

2003-07-17 Thursday 12:28  netterfield

	* 	Possibly reduce non noac nsf mounted dirfile concurrency pathologies

2003-07-17 Thursday 11:15  staikos

	* 	make sure all objects are updated (equations, plugins especially)

2003-07-16 Wednesday 19:47  staikos

	* 	untested spec file for kst, also updated the lsm a bit

2003-07-16 Wednesday 09:17  netterfield

	* 	Pause updates while mouse zooming
	deleted obsolete static
	Should be ready for 0.90 'release'.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 21:34  netterfield

	* 	Stick with ~clean interpolation with bounds checking.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:17  staikos

	* 	don't jump around in the dialogs when an update(-1) is triggered.  this is a bit
	of a hack, but it works flawlessly so far and it's safer than changing the logic
	of update() everywhere.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:05  staikos

	* 	drop the references before updating the plot dialog

2003-07-15 Tuesday 18:46  staikos

	* 	minor cleanups in the plot dialog, and put some assert()s and remove some
	unneeded stuff in kstvector::interpolate

2003-07-15 Tuesday 17:08  staikos

	* 	fix the ref counting in the plot dialog

2003-07-15 Tuesday 16:58  netterfield

	* 	Use local variables for math in kstvector::update.
	84% cpu to 30% cpu in one benchmark....

2003-07-15 Tuesday 16:31  staikos

	* 	refcounting fixes, and disable delete in the dialogs when it is not usable.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 15:44  staikos

	* 	don't access elements of the list that don't exist

2003-07-15 Tuesday 15:21  staikos

	* 	- fix equations which were rather broken
	- fix a c&p copyright that was never editted

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:54  netterfield

	* 	Adjustable update delay in the plot dialog.  Is saved
	in kst file as well.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:20  staikos

	* 	- remove some unused stuff from kstequationcurve
	- make kstvector explicitly ref count to be safe

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:10  staikos

	*
	switch to using a QDict for scalars, and make sure they are cleaned up when the
	parent vector is done with them.  Unfortunately QDict<KSharedPtr<foo> > doesn't
	seem to work too well so this may not last.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 12:00  netterfield

	* 	CPU usage bug in kstrvector fixed
	rework menues

2003-07-15 Tuesday 10:40  staikos

	* 	various minor bugfixes, as well as making scalars and vectors use the same
	namespace.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 09:19  staikos

	* 	The final ref counting bugs that I could find.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 08:43  staikos

	* 	more cleanups, vector removal works

2003-07-15 Tuesday 08:13  staikos

	* 	store data object names

2003-07-14 Monday 21:03  staikos

	* 	some cleanups, comments, and movements

2003-07-14 Monday 20:44  staikos

	* 	-very- close to perfect ref counting (and thus working purging) now.  the only
	remaining problem is that the data manager doesn't display the ref count for
	vectors quite correctly.

2003-07-14 Monday 20:40  staikos

	* 	almost there - only a few extra references are hanging around now!

2003-07-14 Monday 20:08  staikos

	* 	- repair the previous commit
	- remove more stored curve lists.  the hide() trick doesn't work for obvious
	  reasons

2003-07-14 Monday 19:47  staikos

	* 	clean some sprintf()

2003-07-14 Monday 19:35  staikos

	* 	some ref counting fixes, with purge of objects enabled.  still more to be done.

2003-07-14 Monday 18:48  staikos

	* 	- plot dialog doesn't need to keep the curve list around
	- update the data manager last
	- don't access the empty combobox in the curve placement widget

2003-07-14 Monday 12:00  netterfield

	* 	Vector and Rvector work
		-fixed interpolation bugs
		-only the first sample in the last frame is read to make
			interplation with coarser vectors make sense
		-refactored some stuff in RVector - use Vector methods more

2003-07-11 Friday 14:09  staikos

	* 	cleanup some unused stuff

2003-07-11 Friday 14:00  staikos

	* 	port data vectors to the new listview, and clean up after a visit from the
	const police

2003-07-11 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	deleting some types of objects works now
	(those ones also have proper usage counts)

2003-07-11 Friday 03:44  staikos

	* 	Kst provides its own palette now, and use KPalette in kstcolorsequence.

2003-07-11 Friday 03:02  staikos

	* 	palette file with the Kst colours

2003-07-10 Thursday 20:20  netterfield

	* 	psd's use output vectors instead of locally allocated arrays
	output vectors now work from psd's
	fixed 1 off bug in kstvector::interpolate()

2003-07-10 Thursday 05:43  staikos

	* 	some work towards getting the usage counts back in sync

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:53  staikos

	* 	- usage note for kstplugin
	- only activate Edit and Delete buttons when they're meaningful

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:41  staikos

	* 	lots of cleanup, bug fixing, and error handling.  This stuff can now handle
	all kinds of crazy errors like invalid input files, and recover with as much
	information as possible.  For instance, it's now possible to load a plugin with
	invalid input or no output vectors defined and it will notify the user, mark
	the plugin, and wait for it to be repaired.

2003-07-09 Wednesday 14:22  staikos

	* 	lazy load input vectors

2003-07-09 Wednesday 08:50  netterfield

	* 	Fix modality bug in label dialog
	Fix compilation bugs with --enable-final

2003-07-07 Monday 17:51  staikos

	* 	add licence and copyright (as best as could be determined)

	Barth: you might want to change the years on some of these if you care about
	       that.  I just put a generic copyright in place for now.

2003-07-07 Monday 17:27  staikos

	* 	fix bug: error bars were inverted - set none, it tries to use *end().  set one
	  and it wipes out your setting

	add license and copyright

2003-07-07 Monday 16:58  staikos

	* 	- use a static deleter
	- convert the rest of the color stuff that I could find to use KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:36  staikos

	* 	convert to KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:27  staikos

	* 	re-add the color changer.  Could use some enhancement by the artistically
	endowed.  Right now it has the old color list and uses those, along with the
	QColor::dark() versions of those colors.

2003-07-07 Monday 15:01  staikos

	* 	allow Escape to break out of a zoom

2003-07-07 Monday 14:41  netterfield

	* 	Fix bug in psd's
	some progress on real time dirfile vector reading...
		dirfiles are separate files for each field.  They may not
		appear sycronously over NFS unless mounted -o noac.

2003-07-07 Monday 14:07  staikos

	* 	just return garbage instead of crashing

2003-07-07 Monday 13:42  staikos

	* 	explain to the user why we are about to crash with an absolutely baffling
	backtrace

2003-07-07 Monday 11:57  staikos

	* 	urgh this stuff is just too inconsistent in kdelibs :(

	Let's be explicit and manually do what we want in each case.

2003-07-07 Monday 09:50  netterfield

	* 	Usable arbitrary labels (need UI feedback now)
	Fixed vector problems:
		-changing rvector ranges now works
		-fixed sigma and rms scalars

2003-07-07 Monday 03:36  staikos

	* 	workaround for kmainwindow problem

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:53  staikos

	* 	slightly improve the hack and apply it to the statusbar too

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:13  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT warn--

2003-07-06 Sunday 20:10  staikos

	*
	keep the toolbar action status in sync when restoring with session management.

	Is this a kdelibs bug?  It seems to me that this should be automatic.

2003-07-05 Saturday 16:41  netterfield

	* 	Label saving, use scalarwidget in labeldialog.

2003-07-04 Friday 20:51  staikos

	* 	don't crash

2003-07-04 Friday 12:34  netterfield

	* 	added Saving/loading arbitrary labels.

2003-07-04 Friday 11:53  netterfield

	* 	More work on labels:
		-label editing works
		-mouse cursor indicates when you are over an editable label

2003-07-03 Thursday 18:55  staikos

	* 	an example of lazy loading input vectors

2003-07-03 Thursday 17:59  staikos

	* 	cleanup loads of warnings

2003-07-03 Thursday 09:26  staikos

	* 	fix connection

2003-06-29 Sunday 17:22  sleiber

	* 	Fix text

2003-06-29 Sunday 16:31  mlaurent

	* 	";;" -> ";"

2003-06-28 Saturday 12:15  sleiber

	* 	add a caption to the printingdialog

2003-06-28 Saturday 10:07  netterfield

	* 	label selection in process...

2003-06-28 Saturday 07:29  mueller

	* 	speling fixes

2003-06-27 Friday 13:54  staikos

	* 	compile with kdelibs 3.1.x

2003-06-27 Friday 02:29  staikos

	* 	setEnabled/Disabled cleanups

2003-06-27 Friday 02:24  staikos

	* 	KIO enable image saving

2003-06-27 Friday 01:28  staikos

	* 	completely rework the graphics file dialog.  Uses KURLRequester now, supports
	KImageIO, and is far less code in general.  Still needs to be KIO enabled.

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:04  staikos

	* 	graphics.ui is unused, and fix the layouts on graphfiledialog a bit

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:00  staikos

	* 	- use scalarselector in eqdialog, and fix a small bug in scalar selector
	- allow doubleclick in the data manager to bring up the editor dialog

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:48  staikos

	* 	Make sure Apply Edits is the default button on the dialogs.  Also get vector
	lists with <None> working in the vector selector.  Works in the curve dialog
	now.

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:30  staikos

	* 	leak fixes, and add <None> vector to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:47  staikos

	* 	layout fix for plugin dialog, as well as a bug fix.  minor fixes to the scalar
	selector, including a double validator.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:29  staikos

	* 	add the scalar selector, which uses the scalar editor.  Integrate it with the
	plugin dialog to start.  Also bugfixes in the plugin dialog, and in the vector
	selector.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:46  staikos

	* 	The rest of the data manager dialogs use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:23  staikos

	* 	Use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:08  staikos

	* 	switch to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 17:40  staikos

	* 	Add the vector selector widget, along with implementing it in the equation
	dialog.  Seems quite useful so far.
	Also cleanup the vector dialog a bit.
	Also fix that annoying bug where it wouldn't display on startup.  Unfortunately
	it's nothing more than a hack, really.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 15:39  staikos

	* 	a scalar editor dialog for creating custom scalars.  presently unused.  the idea
	is to go from comboboxes or lineedits to actually having a kstvectorselector
	and a kstscalarselector, with a creator button where applicable.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 11:37  staikos

	* 	copy in the backup file code

2003-06-25 Wednesday 09:33  staikos

	* 	not in 3.1 I guess

2003-06-25 Wednesday 00:29  staikos

	* 	remove some code that has lost its usefulness

2003-06-25 Wednesday 00:25  staikos

	* 	vector dialog now uses globalInstance().  Reconnect it to hs, psd and curve
	dialogs as it was before.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 23:49  staikos

	* 	A whole bunch of refactoring.  DataObjects now have a showDialog() method
	which if implemented will show the proper dialog for that object.  KstApp no
	long needs to store eq/plugin/hs/psd/curve dialogs.  Others may follow.  There
	is also no need to do type identification on the object to determine which
	dialog to show it in.

	Dialogs now may emit "modified" to update kstdoc.

	Pointer to KstDoc in dialogs is now deprecated, and hopefully will be fully
	eliminated in the future.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 21:28  staikos

	* 	- clean up our slave vectors and scalars when data objects are deleted.
	- clean up KstFiles when RVectors are removed
	- start to add Purge code, but it doesn't seem to work right.  I think there are
	  still stale references to objects around.  At least it won't crash now, but
	  cleaning up just doesn't work right yet.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 20:43  staikos

	* 	1) I somehow reverted my fix, so restore it: must add to existing plots before
	   adding new ones otherwise the combobox gets desynced.
	2) rework the plugin handling a bit - should work better now
	3) don't allow vectors/scalars to be created with existing labels
	4) vectors/scalars created with blank tag get one automatically assigned.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 16:03  staikos

	* 	HOWTO write plugins

2003-06-24 Tuesday 15:29  staikos

	* 	revert a small part of the last patch, and add backup file support

2003-06-24 Tuesday 15:18  staikos

	* 	session management works now

2003-06-23 Monday 17:25  staikos

	* 	make it clear that there is no typo

2003-06-22 Sunday 15:15  mueller

	* 	speling fixes

2003-06-21 Saturday 16:31  deller

	* 	some cleanups and roaming user fixes: use readPathEntry/writePathEntry instead of readEntry/writeEntry where necessary

2003-06-21 Saturday 00:21  netterfield

	* 	Removed doc dependency from dialogs - use signals.
	Fix hang bug in quick psd dialog
	Fix nan/infinity bug in kstvector.

2003-06-20 Friday 18:52  staikos

	* 	beginnings of session code, not done though.

2003-06-20 Friday 16:14  staikos

	* 	Let kmainwindow store the toolbar/size/etc settings for us

2003-06-20 Friday 14:54  staikos

	* 	factor out more addPlot() code

2003-06-20 Friday 14:41  staikos

	* 	wipe out another copy of addPlot()

2003-06-20 Friday 14:37  staikos

	* 	enable placement in psds, and refactor addPlot as well as make it more
	generally useful and robust

2003-06-20 Friday 13:49  staikos

	* 	moc doesn't like variables in the slots section

2003-06-20 Friday 13:47  staikos

	* 	bye bye quick equations.  they can now be done from the equation dialog, or
	via dcop.

	Also added a routine to create vectors via dcop.  However it makes regular
	vectors which are therefore orphans.  If we decide that this is useful, I guess
	we should make a governor/owner for these things.  In any case, it's useful
	for testing purposes right now.

2003-06-20 Friday 13:32  staikos

	* 	set correct values for the vector's scalars

2003-06-20 Friday 13:17  staikos

	* 	make eqdialog have a curve placement widget and use it.  refactor a bit, with
	much more to come.  a bit more dialog cleanup in place also.  Unfortunately
	there is a bug in eqdialog that makes the plot not use the proper coordinates
	to display with when creating a new plot.  I'll have to try to track this
	down later.

	kstvector now has a method to generate a vector - this didn't belong in
	kstequationcurve.

2003-06-20 Friday 10:11  netterfield

	* 	Limited functionality Arbitrary lables. (Not editable)
	Bug fix in kstplotdialog_i
	some signal re-working

2003-06-20 Friday 01:49  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-06-20 Friday 01:48  staikos

	* 	- add a demo dcop interface.  has methods to list the scalars, list the vectors,
	create an equation plot (basic, slightly incomplete, but usable), and show the
	data manager dialog

	- add a method to kstobjectlist to generate a list of the tagnames

	- notes on refactoring

	-

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:45  staikos

	* 	more conversion to curveplacementwidget

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:18  staikos

	* 	factor out the curve placement code.  Not much gained in terms of lines of code,
	but the ability to change things centrally is nice, and the api is cleansed a
	bit too.

2003-06-19 Thursday 21:32  staikos

	* 	more conversions to the new curve appearance widget, and add more features to it

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT for designer

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	* 	convert to using the new factored out widget

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:36  staikos

	* 	the first refactoring in the dialogs.  This one pulls out curveappearance and
	makes it a separate widget.  It is implemented presently using a "Custom
	Widget" in designer.

	The equation dialog was also enhanced with some setEnabled(bool) connections
	to disable things that can't be used, a horizontal rule, some rearranging, etc

2003-06-17 Tuesday 21:32  staikos

	* 	some cleanup and bug fixes, get rid of null vectors (does this break rvector
	at all? I would think that it does, but I can't see anything broken), and
	put an explicit show() on the view after loading a document to make sure it
	paints.

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:24  staikos

	* 	fix memory corruption

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:02  staikos

	* 	file saving and loading is mostly repaired, along with some memory corruption
	in kstplot.

2003-06-15 Sunday 12:58  staikos

	* 	switch to using NaN for NOPOINT

2003-06-13 Friday 22:21  netterfield

	* 	Better label dialog
	Fixed auto labels

2003-06-13 Friday 19:20  netterfield

	* 	minor cleanups:
	  -remove commented out code
	  -remove unused variable

2003-06-13 Friday 19:15  netterfield

	* 	Fixed scalar substitution in labels.
	Labels now use the KST::scalarList global.
	The scalar list no longer needs to be passed through kstplot.

2003-06-13 Friday 18:49  netterfield

	* 	Fix to symbol font in kstlabels

2003-06-13 Friday 17:02  staikos

	* 	updates from the meeting today

2003-06-13 Friday 09:52  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:50  netterfield

	* 	Adding kstlabeldialog*
	The dialog needs work (to make an understatement...)

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:36  staikos

	* 	not needed

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:26  netterfield

	* 	First steps in adding arbitrarily placable labels....
	Reworked KstMouse in KstView
	Added action

2003-06-12 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	* 	scatter some typenames throughout to make gcc3 happy

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:48  staikos

	* 	add an isNull accessor here, if kstrvector is going to make it null.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:34  staikos

	* 	More of the refactoring done.  slave vectors are history, and shared pointers
	are used almost everywhere now.  Only curves and plots are unshared.  Many
	potential bugs were fixed, and memory doesn't seem to leak, though I haven't
	checked the "reachables" yet according to valgrind.  There are no other
	memory errors to my knowledge.  The only remaining problems are that "Purge"
	doesn't work yet.  This is related to usage count being broken.  There is
	still plenty of cleanup to do, including removing unused variables and member
	variables, unused methods, and some renaming.  There is also some logic that
	can be removed now because it duplicates existing logic.

	The lists that were once in kstdoc are now in a KST:: namespace and global
	in order to facilitate linking purposes and ease of use.  Now scalars and
	vectors add themselves to the global lists automatically.

	Full diff is ~4600 lines.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:22  staikos

	* 	it helps to use the new variable

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:19  staikos

	* 	another access beyond the end of the array while interpolating.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:10  staikos

	* 	don't access beyond the end of the array when scaling

2003-06-10 Tuesday 14:19  staikos

	* 	more cleanup, remove some debug, convert to typedefs instead of big template
	expressions, etc.

2003-06-10 Tuesday 12:50  staikos

	* 	remove some debug, add a compile fix for the new RESTORE() macro

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:08  staikos

	* 	some cleanup

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:03  staikos

	* 	KstFile is now a KstObject.  Needs more work, but everything is functional
	it seems, except perhaps purging.

2003-06-09 Monday 19:36  staikos

	* 	The next big round of changes - no more *vector*list classes anymore.  This is
	basically as functional as before, but quick(psd|equation|*) may not quite
	work right at the moment.  This is easily fixed later.

	There are two known memory errors which will go away as KstFile becomes a
	shared object, and as the Vector classes are reworked for the final time.
	They don't appear to cause much of a problem right now.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 01:42  staikos

	* 	First major portion of the cleanup - refactor into KstDataObjects, not counting
	KstFile.  Vectors are not changed.  This removes all kinds of code duplication
	though much still remains.  Some things are still not ideal but they're
	getting closer.  It is quite likely that this patch broke things, but the very
	basics still seem to work fine.

	Removes 1000-1500 lines of code.

2003-06-02 Monday 20:08  staikos

	* 	more reworking of the classes - dataObjectList is now used in kstdoc, though
	the curves are still separate

2003-06-02 Monday 15:35  staikos

	* 	add debug temporarily to track usage

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:12  staikos

	* 	count()->length() for the vector

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:11  staikos

	* 	Some of the changes to the vectors are started.  I'm doing these incrementally,
	and periodically somethings may break.  For instance, vector usage counts
	probably do not work right now, though they will work again once the changes
	are complete.  This change mostly changes method names, adds some new ones,
	removes some that need to disappear, etc.  The next change will likely be
	the use of KSharedPtr<> instead of the raw pointer (which will -mostly- fix
	the usage count again).  There are probably memory leaks right now.

2003-06-01 Sunday 17:20  staikos

	* 	more cleanup

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:44  staikos

	* 	cleanups

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:30  staikos

	* 	- kstscalarlist.cpp is no longer needed
	- fix a bug in kstcurvedialog where it didn't plot in an existing plot AND
	  in a separate plot

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:25  staikos

	* 	Most finish the Scalar conversion to the new object model.  Seems to have
	cleaned up many memory issues, as well as removed lots of code!  There is
	still much more code to remove or change to using iterators too.

2003-05-28 Wednesday 17:19  staikos

	* 	compile fixes

2003-05-28 Wednesday 17:16  staikos

	* 	updates

2003-05-28 Wednesday 16:27  staikos

	* 	add the realloced methods

2003-05-28 Wednesday 16:12  staikos

	* 	First step in refactoring:
	- move functions defined in the UML diagram up into parent classes
	- redo the inheritence (mostly done)
	- other minor cleanups

2003-05-28 Wednesday 14:28  staikos

	* 	init the variable

2003-05-26 Monday 17:49  staikos

	* 	updates from the meeting

2003-05-26 Monday 11:21  netterfield

	* 	Changes to kstview: better qpixmap handling.

2003-05-25 Sunday 15:02  staikos

	* 	misc cleanups

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:53  staikos

	* 	no use passing around static data

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:40  staikos

	* 	add samples for these two base classes.  kstdataobject was not touched because
	it is in use already, but it's the next one to integrate.

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:23  staikos

	* 	this should not be in CVS

2003-05-25 Sunday 13:04  staikos

	* 	slight layout adjustments and resize the font for non-2560x1024 screens :)

2003-05-25 Sunday 12:01  staikos

	* 	remove the second METASOURCES line that was commented out anyways.

2003-05-25 Sunday 09:54  mlaurent

	* 	Use KCmdLineLastOption

2003-05-24 Saturday 20:48  staikos

	* 	version 0.89, update copyrights

2003-05-23 Friday 22:10  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-05-23 Friday 21:52  staikos

	* 	interpolate X as needed - not well tested, but seems to work

2003-05-23 Friday 20:32  staikos

	* 	spelling fix Lable->Label

2003-05-23 Friday 17:51  staikos

	* 	plugin loading and saving - as much as can be done

2003-05-23 Friday 17:22  staikos

	* 	edit works as advertised now, updating the data manager properly.

2003-05-23 Friday 17:15  staikos

	* 	edit fixes, still not fully working.  Data manager gets confused.

2003-05-23 Friday 16:48  staikos

	* 	clean up vectors when new plugin fails

2003-05-23 Friday 16:15  staikos

	* 	- avoid a crash by leaking memory until we can fix the architecture properly
	- detect errors when trying to create a new plugin

2003-05-23 Friday 15:53  staikos

	* 	switch to using a lineedit for outputs

2003-05-23 Friday 15:09  staikos

	* 	pass in a, b, chi^2 as scalars

2003-05-23 Friday 14:38  staikos

	* 	typo => wrong results

2003-05-23 Friday 14:17  staikos

	* 	oops

2003-05-23 Friday 13:46  staikos

	* 	compiling with warning is better than erroring

2003-05-23 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT

2003-05-23 Friday 13:35  staikos

	* 	line fitting plugin example

2003-05-22 Thursday 21:43  staikos

	* 	update - more information, slight refactoring

2003-05-22 Thursday 20:58  staikos

	* 	UML for the redesigned data object hierarchy

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:50  staikos

	* 	compilation fixes

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:25  netterfield

	* 	Made kstvector a kstdataobject
		this breaks d2asc compiles, but kst is still OK: Help
	Made doc->scalarList a static member of kstvector, so that kstvectors
		can insert their scalars into the list.

	I think it would be better to add doc->scalarList to KstScalar
		and doc->vectorList as static member of KstVector so things
		can insert and delete themselves!

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:17  staikos

	* 	don't double delete

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:07  staikos

	* 	Fix vector leaks

2003-05-22 Thursday 18:58  staikos

	* 	plugin editting works, more crashes removed

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:52  staikos

	* 	make the dialog show the correct combobox values in edit mode.

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:23  staikos

	* 	Lots of plugin work.  Unfortunately the vector architecture is becoming a real
	problem now.  I had to put in lots of hacks that could go away if we make all
	vectors the same (or specialised) as discussed.  I think this has to happen
	sooner rather than later.

	The vector list classes need to be reworked too.

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:39  staikos

	* 	fix scalar parsing in the XML and add widget spacing to the generated dialog

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:28  staikos

	* 	a demo with scalars

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:13  staikos

	* 	This didn't work in HEAD for some reason, but worked in branch.  This patch
	ensures it works everywhere.

2003-05-22 Thursday 02:26  staikos

	* 	pass in the input vectors to the plugin

2003-05-22 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	* 	show the associated vectors, increment their usage, etc

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:39  staikos

	* 	update the plugins to reflect the new memory scheme

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:35  staikos

	* 	call the plugins

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:26  staikos

	* 	- change the default action in plugin dialog from delete to save
	- make kstdataobject KShared because eventually all dataobjects will be
	  KShared probably.
	- return const QString& from accessor in kstdataobject
	- note about vector and scalar lists moving into kstdataobject eventually

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:01  staikos

	* 	- fix a bug in plugins since the change to KstDataObject
	- make the plugin code generate unique names like the other objects
	- add plugins to the data manager window (without the vectors currently)

2003-05-21 Wednesday 21:57  staikos

	* 	move "Loaded" over one column.  It looks better to select the plugin name, not
	it's loaded state pixmap.

2003-05-21 Wednesday 14:35  netterfield

	* 	Fix update bug:
		call update on all dependancies liberally
		call update on all slaves
		use a counter to avoid re-updates
		note: recursion is not detected, will produce junk results, but
			should not crash

2003-05-20 Tuesday 09:35  staikos

	* 	CVS_SILENT while you're at it, might as well make this "cannot" then.

2003-05-20 Tuesday 04:19  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT i18n style guide fixes

2003-05-16 Friday 11:28  staikos

	* 	for now, just don't crash until the code is complete

2003-05-16 Friday 04:21  staikos

	* 	work on calling the plugin.  slightly incomplete pending discussion on
	memory management

2003-05-16 Friday 03:36  staikos

	* 	lots of bug fixes

2003-05-16 Friday 02:36  staikos

	* 	add another deep and meaningful plugin for testing

2003-05-16 Friday 02:33  staikos

	* 	- missed a constructor initialisation
	- add debug statements to show that refcounting is working

2003-05-16 Friday 02:22  staikos

	* 	make it do what the xml file says it does

2003-05-16 Friday 02:14  staikos

	* 	new, edit, delete of plugins works, though not all fields are saved yet.

2003-05-16 Friday 00:01  staikos

	* 	saving new plugins and deleting old ones now works partially

2003-05-15 Thursday 23:39  staikos

	* 	more plugin implementation

2003-05-15 Thursday 23:07  staikos

	* 	more plugin work.  starting to integrate them into the app.

	Using KSharedPtr<> instead of homebrew ref counting.

2003-05-15 Thursday 22:45  staikos

	* 	some thoughts

	* 	- fix plugin removal
	- minor UI fix

2003-05-15 Thursday 20:47  staikos

	* 	add some input and output that doesn't come close to matching the plugin yet :)

2003-05-15 Thursday 19:39  staikos

	* 	fill in the scalar and vector lists

2003-05-15 Thursday 18:00  staikos

	* 	rename

2003-05-15 Thursday 13:56  staikos

	* 	restore some of this code

2003-05-14 Wednesday 12:35  staikos

	* 	switch kstxml->xml

2003-05-14 Wednesday 11:26  netterfield

	* 	Rework of KstFile:
		Use QFile (where possible) and KTempFile
		Bug fix (massive speedup) in reading data from stdin
	removed some warnings from readdata

2003-05-14 Wednesday 01:17  staikos

	* 	plugin installer

	* 	plugin changes as discussed, including:
	- Reference counting of plugins
	- Load only on demand
	- remove unnecessary UI elements

2003-05-13 Tuesday 20:28  staikos

2003-05-13 Tuesday 19:48  staikos

	* 	unused args

	* 	check endian

2003-05-13 Tuesday 14:16  staikos

	* 	API to call the plugin function

2003-05-13 Tuesday 14:06  staikos

	* 	can't use a map here since order is important

2003-05-13 Tuesday 13:24  staikos

	* 	simplify, and add two more

2003-05-13 Tuesday 13:23  staikos

	* 	The plugin dialog.

2003-05-13 Tuesday 12:03  staikos

	* 	extract the symbol from the plugin

		Increased use of QStrings

	There is still work do be done in the ASCII data file parser.

2003-05-09 Friday 12:49  fawcett

	* 	malloc.h is dead, so it can go bye-bye

	deprecated/obsoleted, use stdlib.h instead (and you already include that)

2003-05-08 Thursday 15:12  binner

	* 	CVS_SILENT i18n style guide fixes

2003-05-07 Wednesday 19:15  staikos

	* 	Convert all the forms:

	const SomePrimitiveType& parameter

	to just

	SomePrimitiveType paramter

	Especially in cases where the parameter had a default value.

	Also some i18n() and other cleanup.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 18:18  staikos

	* 	- some i18n fixes
	- get rid of unnecessary casts
	- don't cast (QString)"foo".  Use QString("foo") if really needed, or better,
	  rework it so it can be i18n("")
	- (float)foo -> float(foo) etc
	- const bool& is a bad idea and does nothing of benefit over bool.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 18:03  staikos

	* 	more const/inheritence cleanup

2003-05-07 Wednesday 17:44  staikos

	* 	better be safe with free()

2003-05-07 Wednesday 17:42  staikos

	Also cleanups, refactorizations, micro optimisations

2003-05-07 Wednesday 16:29  staikos

	* 	fix new[]/delete mismatch.  Still, this code also uses realloc().  Needs more
	work.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 16:08  staikos

	* 	memleak fix

2003-05-07 Wednesday 15:57  staikos

	* 	note for future

2003-05-07 Wednesday 15:53  staikos

	* 	A huge number of memory corruption/leak bugfixes, i18n() fixes, constness
	fixes, inheritence fixes, and more.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 14:36  staikos

	* 	The last uninitialised var (tricky to track this one down).
	Also a few minor reformatting and setting freed variables to 0L.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 13:21  staikos

	* 	- Don't allow access to array[-1].
	- Make the for(;;); a little more explicit

2003-05-07 Wednesday 13:12  staikos

	* 	Un-broke file reading.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 04:50  coolo

	* 	little cleanup (note though that the actions icons were better installed into
	kde_datadir instead of kde_icondir. But that requires code changes)

2003-05-06 Tuesday 18:22  staikos

	* 	Don't leak, init variables

2003-05-06 Tuesday 17:59  staikos

	* 	Fix uninit variables.  This could cause crashes on non-GCC compilers.
	(especially SIGFPE)

2003-05-06 Tuesday 17:27  staikos

	* 	Representation class for a plugin - presently empty until we get a plugin
	example and can complete the plugin loader

2003-05-06 Tuesday 17:20  staikos

	* 	The rest of the plugin XML parser

2003-05-06 Tuesday 15:41  staikos
