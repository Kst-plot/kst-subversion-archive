March 30: 
  hard string freeze, except for docs.
Before April 6: 
  Docs merged and reviewed.
April 6: 
  1.4.0 is cut, for review over the weekend
  1.5.0 branch is formed, 1.4 remains as HEAD
April 9: 
  1.4.0 released to great fanfare.
  Docs frozen
May 4: 
  1.4.1 is cut for review over the weekend
May 7:
  1.4.1 is released.
  1.4.2_devel moved to a branch
  1.5.0_devel moved to head

So:
-the string freeze for the 1.4 series starts March 30 and is never lifted.
-after April 6, new features, and string modifications are allowed in the
 1.5.0 branch (which will become HEAD on May 7)
-the docs freeze for the 1.4 series starts April 9 and is never lifted.
-the requirement for review for all submissions to 1.4.0 remains
 permenantly.
