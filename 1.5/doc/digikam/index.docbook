       <title>About &digikam;</title>

       <para>
       &digikam; is an advanced digital photo management application for the &kde; desktop. It provides a simple interface which makes importing and organizing digital photographs a "snap". &digikam; enables you to manage large numbers of digital photographs in Albums and to organize these photographs for easy retrieval using tags. It has many features for viewing, organizing, manipulating and sharing your pictures.
       </para>
    
       <para>
       An easy to use Camera interface is provided, that will connect to your digital camera and download photographs directly into &digikam; Albums. More than 800 digital cameras are supported through the gphoto2 library.
       </para>
       
       <para>&digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with basic image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs, comment and rate them, make corrections and alterations. The editing power can be easily extended by a set of plugins, the <ulink url="http://www.kipi-plugins.org">Kde Image Plugins Interface</ulink> (<ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/index.html">manual</ulink>) 
       </para>

       <para>While &digikam; remains easy to use, it provides professional level features by the dozens. It is fully 16 bit enabled including all available plugins, supports RAW format conversion through David Coffins dcraw and ICC color management work flow.
       </para>
       
       </sect2>

       <sect2>
       <title>Reporting Bugs</title>

       <para>
       Like the rest of &kde;, &digikam; is an Open Source project. This means that it relies on its users to play their part by, at least, reporting problems and suggesting possible improvements.
       </para>

       <para>
       &digikam; makes it as easy as possible for you to report bugs or suggest improvements. Wherever you are in the application the Help menu will include a Report Bugs option. This will display a message box with a highlighted link. Click on the link and your web browser will open the page for the reporting system. All the information required will already be filled in, just follow the instructions for completing your report.
       </para>
       </sect2>

       <sect2>
       <title>Support</title>
      
       <para>
       &digikam; is a community supported project, which means that users and developers support one another. If you become a regular user of &digikam; you are encouraged to join the &digikam; Users Mailing List. You can start off by asking questions of other &digikam; users and hopefully soon you will be answering the support questions of others.

       <title>Getting Involved</title>

       <para>
       There are many ways that you can get involved with the continued development of &digikam;. You do not need to be a software developer. You can help with documentation, translation and user interface design or just contribute really good ideas to the wish-list. You can also get involved by testing early development code as it is being developed and providing feedback to the developers. Of course, if you are a software developer then you can help to make &digikam; the best digital photograph application there is. 
       </para>

       <para>
       The best way to start getting involved with &digikam; is to join the Developers Mailing List.

        <para>
        When you start &digikam; for the very first time it will ask you where you store your photographs. You can type in the path name of a folder or click on the <guilabel>folder</guilabel> icon
        <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject><imagedata fileref="introductionfoldericon.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
            <textobject> <phrase>Folder Icon</phrase> </textobject>

        to select a folder from the dialog.

        </sect2>

        <sect2>
        <title>The Scan Items Dialog</title>

        <para>
        If you already have a collection of photographs on your hard disk, you can enter the top-level folder containing the photographs, this is called the Albums Library folder. &digikam; will treat each sub-folder of the folder you've entered as an Album. None of the photographs will be altered. During folders parsing you can see a progress dialog like this:
        </para>
        <para>
          <inlinemediaobject> <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="introductionscandialog.png" format="PNG" /> </imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
        </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
        <title>The Albums Missing Dialog</title>
        <para>This parsing for modifications happens at every application start-up, but it can be disabled in the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> under <guilabel>Miscellaneous</guilabel>
	</para>
	<para>
          As &digikam; uses your folders on your hard disk directly, other applications like file managers can remove any albums outside a &digikam; session. In this case &digikam; will tell you at the next session if all albums that have been removed from the &digikam; photographs root path shall be deleted from albums database. If you want to move folders around and do not want to do that in &digikam;, we suggest you do that while &digikam; is running, so the database will be kept in sync and you do not lose any metadata.
        </para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject><imageobject>

        <para>
        When you use an existing folder of photographs, as the Album Library folder, you will notice that the Albums in the My Album list do not have photographs as their icons. The first time you view each Album &digikam; will create a thumbnail from the first photograph in the Album and use this as the Album icon. See the <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">My Album</link> section for details of how to change the Album icon.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you have previously accessed your photograph collection with another application, that has created thumbnails in non-standard sub-folders, &digikam; will show these thumbnail folders as separate Albums. &digikam; follows the <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</ulink> standards for thumbnail folders. There is no way of hiding non-standard thumbnail folders from the "My Album" list. If you want to keep them you could create an Album Collection that just contains all the thumbnail Folders and then view your Albums in By Collection order. See the <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">My Album</link> section for more about Album Collections.
        </para>

        <para>
        Once you have configured the Album Library Folder you can setup &digikam; to work with your digital camera. Then learn how to use <link linkend="using-myalbumsview">My Albums</link> and <link linkend="using-mytagsview">My Tags</link> to arrange your photograph Albums.

        <title>Still Photograph Formats</title>
        
            <sect3>
            <title>Introduction</title>
    
                <para>
                Almost all digital cameras store photographs in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. Many cameras enable you to select which of these formats to use. A full description of these formats can be found at the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_file_format">Wikipedia</ulink>. &digikam; supports both of these formats.
                </para>
            
            </sect3>

            <sect3>
            <title>Still Image Compression</title>
    
                <para>
                Image compression is the application of data compression schemes on digital images. It is done through reducing redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form.
                </para>
            
                <para>
                Image compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression methods are always preferred for their high preservation value for archival purposes before applying transformations like cropping, resizing, color corrections, &etc;. This is because lossy compression methods, especially when used at low bit rates, introduce compression artifacts. Lossy methods are suitable for natural images such as photos in applications where minor (sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial reduction in file size. Lossy compression is good for image publishing on the Internet.
                </para>
            
            </sect3>
            
            <sect3>
            <title>JPEG</title>
                <para>
                JPEG is a compressed format, that trades some of the image quality to keep filesizes small. In fact, most cameras save their images in this format unless you specify otherwise. A JPEG image is stored using lossy compression and you can vary the amount of compression. This allows you to choose between lower compression and higher image quality or greater compression and poorer quality. The only reason to choose higher compression is because it creates smaller file so you can store more images, and it is easier to send them by e-mail, or post them on the Web. Most cameras give you two or three choices equivalent to good, better, best although the names vary.
                </para>
		<para>
		JPEG 2000 is supported as well. In general it give for the same compression ratio the better (smoother) results compared to JPEG. The 2000 version has the option of being lossless if so specified in the settings.
		</para>
            
            </sect3>

            <sect3>
            <title>TIFF</title>
                <para>
                TIFF has been widely accepted and widely supported as an image format. Commonly, TIFF may be stored by the camera in uncompressed form or using lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). It maintains higher image quality but at the expense of much larger filesizes. Some cameras let you save your images in this format and it is a popular format because of its lossless compression algorithm. The problem is that the format has been altered by so many people that there are now 50 or more flavors and not all are recognizable by programs.
                </para>
            
            </sect3>

            <sect3>
            <title>PNG</title>
                <para>
                PNG is an image format that was developed as a replacement for a number of older, in the 1990's widely used, image file formats. It is a lossless format like TIFF but it is much more compact and saves disk space. Although your camera is unlikely to support PNG, some people like to convert their photographs to PNG as soon as they get them on their computer. Unlike JPEG, PNG images do not lose quality every time you re-encode them after modification. &digikam; fully supports PNG images and the Batch Processing Images Plugin can convert a batch of images from any supported format to PNG in one step. See the <link linkend="using-setup">Configuration</link> section for information about using plugins with &digikam;.
                </para>
    
                <para>
                PNG is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for &GIF; and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in on-line viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. PNG supports 8 and 16 bits / colors /pixels depth. It's the perfect file format to archive your photographs. For more information about the PNG format see the <ulink url="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">PNG homepage</ulink>.

            <title>RAW</title>
                
                <para>
                Some, typically more expensive, cameras allow you to store images in RAW format. RAW format is not really an image standard at all. It is different for every make of camera. RAW format images contain all the data that is taken directly from the camera's image sensor before the software in the camera applies things like white balance, sharpening &etc;. Storing  photographs in a camera's RAW format allows you to alter settings, such as white balance, after the photograph has been taken. Most professional photographers use RAW format, because it offers them maximum flexibility. The downside is that RAW image files can be very large indeed. 
                </para>
                
                <para>
                If you want to learn more about RAW image format visit the very helpful guides<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW_image_format"> Wikipedia</ulink> <ulink url="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml"> The Luminous Landscape</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/RAW-file-format.htm"> Cambridge in Colour</ulink>. You can convert RAW format images into JPEG or TIFF in &digikam; using the <ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/rawconverter.html">RAW Image Converter plugin</ulink>.

        <title>Moving Image Formats (Videos)</title>

        <para>
        Many digital cameras support taking of short movie clips. These clips are usually stored in AVI or MPEG format. &digikam; understands these formats and will generate thumbnails for the movie files. However, &digikam; is not a movie editing application and it does not have any built-in movie viewing or editing capabilities. If you double click on a movie file &digikam; will use your &kde; settings to choose a viewing application to use.

        <title>How &digikam; Supports File Formats</title>

        <para>
        &digikam; relies on a number of libraries and support packages to load and save image formats. Which image formats are available will depend on the availability of these libraries on your system and, in some cases, on the way that those libraries have been compiled. On most distributions you will find that a wide range of image formats are viewable within &digikam;.
        </para>

        <para>
        This dependence on other libraries means that it is not possible to give a definitive list of all of the formats that will be available on your system. At the very least JPEG, PNG, and TIFF will be available.
        </para>

        <para>
        &digikam; only displays files that are in formats that it understands. It does this by looking at the file extension on the files and checking this against a predefined list. If the file extension is in the list &digikam; will show the file in the Image View. You can change the list of file extensions that &digikam; will accept, see the <link linkend="using-setup">Configuration</link> section for more details.

 <sect1 id="using-pluginssupport">     <title>Supported Plugins</title>

        <para>
        One of the nicest things about &digikam; is how easily its functionality can be extended, by using plugins:
        
        <itemizedlist>

        <para>                                                    
         Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their advantage is, that it is much easier to add a capability to &digikam; by writing a small plugin than by modifying the &digikam; core.

            &digikam; employs the <emphasis>gPhoto2</emphasis> program to communicate with digital still cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable set of digital camera software applications which supports a growing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 has support for the <emphasis>Picture Transfer Protocol</emphasis>, which is a widely-supported protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association to allow the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional device drivers.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            Many old digital still cameras used <emphasis>Serial Port</emphasis> to communicate with host computer. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers are slow, this connection is now obsolete. &digikam; supports these cameras and performs image transfers using the gPhoto2 program.

            The "My Albums" tree provides an organized view of your photograph albums. All photographs that are managed by &digikam; are stored in a single folder branch. The albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the Collection name that has been set in the Album Properties or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the Properties of each Album).

                There are a number of ways to create a new Album. You can create a new Album when you upload new photographs from the Camera using the Camera Tool. You can also create a new empty Album by clicking the <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu> </menuchoice> button on the toolbar. As an additional option, you can create a new Album by importing an existing folder of photographs from your computer, just select <menuchoice><guimenu>Album</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Import Folders</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu Bar and select the folder that you want to import. An Album will be created with the same name as the hard disk folder. You can use drag and drop to import a folder. Drag a folder icon, for example from a &konqueror; window. Than drop it on the album list on the left. A menu will appear that gives you the option to move or copy the folder into &digikam;.

                When you delete an Album from &digikam; it will be moved into the &kde; Trash Can. As an option you could change this behavior, so that delete really did remove the Album and all of the photographs in it. This can be changed by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure &digikam;</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and selecting the Miscellaneous page. At the top of this page are the settings that control what happens when a photograph is deleted. To delete an Album right-click the Album in the "My Album" tree and select Delete Album from Hard Disk from the context menu.

                Most of the time you will create new Albums and populate them with photographs directly from your camera using the Camera Tool. However, sometimes you may want to add a photograph that you already have on your computer to an existing Album. To add a photograph to an Album, make sure that the Album is selected. Then, either click the <guilabel>Add Images</guilabel> icon in the toolbar or select <menuchoice><guimenu>Album</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Add Images</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Menu Bar. Select the photographs that you want to add from the file dialog and click <guilabel>Open</guilabel>. The photographs will be copied into the Album. Additionally, you can use drag and drop to import photographs. Drag the photographs icons, for example from a &konqueror; window. Than drop it on the image list on the right hand side.

                Many digital cameras now have an orientation sensor. This sensor can detect how you hold the camera while taking a picture. It stores this orientation information inside the image. This meta data is stored in an embedded meta-data section called EXIF. The cameras could rotate the image themselves right away, but they have limited processing power, so they leave this job to an application like &digikam;. If the camera is storing the orientation, then &digikam; can use it to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up when you display them. &digikam; will rotate the picture on disk according to this orientation information.

            Tags can be arranged in a hierarchical tree. This allows you to organize your Tags in a logical manner. It also allows you to collapse parts of the tree in the "My Tags" list so that you can easily find the Tags that you are looking for.

             <tip>
              <para>Tags are stored in a database for fast access, and, the applied tags are written into IPTC data fields of the image (at least for JPEG). So can use your tags with other programs or, on case of loss of that data in the database, the tags will be re-imported when the image is noticed by &digikam;.</para></tip>

                Before you can get the most out of &digikam;'s Tagging capabilities you must first tag your photographs. There are two methods of tagging photographs. Once you have identified the photographs that you want to tag you can either drag and drop them onto the Tag in the "My Tags" tree or, by right-clicking on the selected photographs in the Image Window, you can use the <guilabel>Assign Tag</guilabel> menu to select the Tags you wish to set.

                <para>
                You can label a photograph with as many Tags as you like. The photograph will appear when you select any of the Tags that are set against it. This way you can set a Tag for each person in a photograph, as well as the place the photograph was taken, the event it was taken at, &etc;.

                Quick Search provides you with a simple search form to search all data fields in the album library with a single query. You can enter any arguments in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the string 'birthday' to search the complete album library for occurrences of the word 'birthday' in photograph description, or '05.png' to search for a specific image file name '05.png' (no escaping as in regexpressions needed).

                The Quick Search really works intuitively. If you want to search photographs from a certain date, you can simply type <userinput>2005</userinput>, but it is even possible to search for a certain month. Just enter the name of the month in your local language. If it is Dutch, you can enter <userinput>Maart</userinput>, to see the pictures of March. The combination of 'Maart 2006' means 'Maart AND 2006' and therefore is equivalent to '2006 Maart'. Or look for 'Maart 2007 cr2' to find all RAW files of March 2007.

                    The EXIF standard defines a Makernote tag, which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format metadata in the file. This is used increasingly by camera manufacturers to store a myriad of camera settings not listed in the EXIF standard, such as shooting modes, post-processing settings, serial number, focusing modes, &etc; As this tag format is proprietary and manufacturer-specific.

                    The IPTC was established in 1965 by a group of news organizations to safeguard the telecommunications interests of the world's press. Since the late 1970s IPTC's activities have primarily focused on developing and publishing industry standards for the interchange of news data.

                    <para>
                    In particular, the IPTC defined a set of metadata attributes that can be applied to images. These were defined originally in 1979, and revised significantly in 1991 to be the "Information Interchange Model" (IIM), but the concept really advanced in 1994 when Adobe defined a specification for actually embedding the metadata into digital image files - known as "IPTC headers".

           This sidebar tab serves to apply and edit image attributes like comments, rating, date and tags. The attributes are stored in the associated database, in the IPTC and EXIF data fields and become part of the image. All attributes are accessible in one sidebar view as shown in the screenshot below. During image reading the order of priority is a) database b) IPTC and c) EXIF. So if there is a discrepancy between any of the three, this priority will take effect and a synchronization will take place. This sidebar has a first-previous-next-last arrow navigator field on top if shown in the main application.

          <title>Comment View</title>
           <para>
           The comment view can be used to type or paste in a comment of unlimited size (see note below). The text is UTF-8 compatible, meaning that all special characters are allowed. The comments are copied to EXIF and IPTC comment fields to be used from other applications.
           </para>
           <caution><para>
           The IPTC data does only support ASCII characters and 2000 characters at most (old American norm). All comments will be truncated after 2000 chars, and special characters will be malformed. If you intend to use the IPTC comment field in other applications you should be compliant with these restrictions.

          <title>Date &amp; Time</title>

           <para>
           In the Date &amp; Time section, which reflects the time of taking the photograph, you can change all values. From the date combo-box a calender opens, and the time setting spin-box can also be written by directly typing the time. The dating is copied to the EXIF 'Date and Time' field. If you need to change a number of images for their creating time &amp; date, there is a more comfortable method available (requiring the kipi-plugins). This latter option can be found under <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Image</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Adjust time &amp; date...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Select the images to be changed in the main view and call the plugin.

          <title>Rating</title>

           <para>
           The Rating section displays a 0...5 star rating scheme that can be used in searches and sort orders. It can be applied by a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with a keyboard short-cut Ctrl+0...5. The rating from the sidebar is always applied to one image at a time. To rate a number of images, select them and pop-up the context menu (right-click) to apply a common rating.
           </para>
           <para>The rating is then transcribed into the IPTC 'urgency' data field. The transcoding follows the scheme in this table:

          <title>Tag Tree</title>

           <para>
           The Tag view shows an adaptive filter tag search box, the tag tree and a combo-box containing the tags previously applied in this &digikam; session.
           </para>
           <para>
           The tag tree will be adapted dynamically as a function of the search word as you type into the box. So it is easy to quickly reduce the number of possibilities when searching for a tag. Of course, this feature is only useful if you have many tags.
           </para>

           <para>
           The combo-box at the bottom is another ergonomic feature for easy tagging of an image series. As you apply different tags they will be memorized in this box for quick access. 
           </para>

           <para>
           Otherwise tags are simply applied by checking the respective boxes in the tree. All tags of an image are transcribed into the IPTC 'keyword' data field.
           </para>
           <note><para>
            In case you have selected a number of images in the main view and you check a tag in the tag tree, this one is only applied to the highlighted image, and not to the whole selection. If you want to tag selections, refer to the <link linkend="using-sidebartagfilters">Tag filters</link> section.

        <sect2 id="using-sidebartagfilters">
        <title>Tag Filters</title>
           <para>
           The tag filter sidebar is used to modify the set of images displayed in the main window view. Normally one uses the left sidebar with its Album, Date, Tag and Searches view. When additionally one or more tags on right sidebar tag filter is checked, only the cross-section of these two selections will be displayed. All created tags are available. 
           </para>
           <para>
           To give an example, suppose you have a tag called 'public' which tags all images except your private ones. Then you can check this 'public' tag in the right sidebar to hide the private pictures (all those not having 'public' tag). Whatever view mode you chose from the left sidebar, 'public' only picture will be displayed. Another typical example is the selection of a subset of tags in a hierarchical tree. Suppose you want to display 'red' and 'green' from a tag tree containing 7 different colors as sub-tags. Simply click on the 'color' tag of the main view and check 'red' and 'green' from the right sidebar.
           </para>
           <para>Another use is <emphasis>drag-and-drop tagging</emphasis>. Lets say you selected in the main view a number of pictures to tag them. If the tag already exists, simply drag it from the right sidebar onto the selection (any one of the highlighted pictures). A dialog will pop-up and ask if this tag should be applied.
           </para>

           </para>

            <para>
                In the above example the main window shows the pictures from a calender date, the tag filter is set to 'not tagged', which reduces the set to 3 images. They have been selected with Ctrl+a, then a tag is dragged from the right tag tree over the selection and dropped. A pop-up dialog asks if the tag shall be applied.

            The Camera Tool allows you to download your photographs directly from your camera into a &digikam; Album. You can access the Camera Tool by clicking on the Camera menu and selecting from the list of configured Cameras. See the <link linkend="cameraselection.anchor">Setup Camera Section</link> of the manual for instructions on how to setup &digikam; to work with your Camera. If you want to have more information about how &digikam; supports digital camera, please a take a look at <link linkend="using-camerasupport">this section</link>.

            <para>
            When you start the Camera Interface, it will try to connect to the Camera. For some cameras this connection phase can take a little while. When connected, a <guilabel>Ready</guilabel> indicator will appear on the bottom and thumbnails of any photographs on the camera will be displayed. Some cameras cannot provide thumbnails of the photographs, if this is the case you will only see the filenames and an mime-type icon for each items stored by your camera (photograph, movies, sounds, etc).

            The simplest way to download photographs from your camera to your computer is to click the <guilabel>Download</guilabel> button and then click <guilabel>Download All</guilabel>. This will download all of the photographs on the camera to a single Album in &digikam;. The download process will not remove the photographs from the camera. It is always advisable to check that the photographs have downloaded safely into the Album you were expecting before deleting them from the camera.
            </para>
        
            <para>
            If you do not want to download all of the photographs you can select just those that you need using the standard &kde; selection methods. Once you have the photographs selected click <guilabel>Download</guilabel> and then <guilabel>Download Selected</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Download Selected</guilabel> button will be grayed out until you have selected some photographs.

            <note><para>
            If supported by your camera an option <guilabel>Download new</guilabel> is available. Those are pictures not yet downloaded by &digikam;. In that case the new pictures are already marked with a star in the thumbnail window. Obviously if you choose this handy option, it will download the new pictures only.

            <para>
            Once you are happy with the downloaded photographs that you wanted, you are ready to delete photographs from the Camera. You can delete all of the photographs in one go by clicking the
            <menuchoice>

            <guimenuitem>Delete Selected</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            </para>

            <caution><para>
            Please note that there is no way to restore a photo that you have deleted from the camera. The photographs are not moved to the &kde; Trash Can, they are removed completely. It is best to double check that you have successfully downloaded a photograph into a &digikam; Album before you delete it from the camera. Anyway, if you plan to empty the camera card, you better do that from the camera menu because it is much quicker.

        <title>Automatic Renaming</title>

            <para>
            Cameras often do not use very meaningful filenames for photographs. The filenames are usually reused once the photographs have been deleted from the camera. This can lead to filename clashes if you download photographs from many shootings into the same Album. It can also be useful to include the date and time that a picture was taken into the filename.

            <para>
            &digikam; can automatically rename your photographs using the date and time information included by the camera in the photograph. To use this feature, click the <guilabel>Settings</guilabel> button on the Camera Interface. The Camera Interface window will expand to reveal some extra features. Select <guilabel>Customize</guilabel> and then enter any filename prefix you would like. As an option you can then add the date &amp; time, a sequence number or a combination of both. The sequence number may be needed if you have a camera with a very fast multi-shoot mode where it is possible to get two photographs with exactly the same data and time.

                    </inlinemediaobject>GPS (global positioning system) is used as a generic term throughout this document, it just means a location in latitude and longitude global coordinates that can be displayed on a map. The actual technical implementation that provides the data can be the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.

                Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image to a precise geographical location. Not everybody uses an airplane to overfly and scan a certain area with automatic GPS data recording. Environmental planners, military, police, construction bureaus, real estate agencies, all will have an immediate application.

                But if, after some time, one has forgotten where the picture was taken, if one loves the nice feature to open with a simple click a browser displaying a zoom of the area, if you like to send your picture as a postcard to another &digikam; user (who is then able to locate your shot), or if you simply need the documentation aspect of it - having position data stored in a photo is great.

                Now, how do we get GPS data into the images? First it is to say that <ulink url="http://www.exiv2.org/tags.html">exif2</ulink> supports many kinds of the GPS data fields, even bearing, satellite and map references. So the question is really how to get the data into those fields? There are at least three ways to do this: directly with the appropriate hardware, per post-treatment of GPS and image files using the <ulink url="http://www.kipi-plugins.org">Geolocalization</ulink> (<ulink url="help:/kipi-plugins/geolocalization.html">Manual</ulink>) kipi-plugin and per 'manual' insertion of known locations.

                        The approach is dead easy: whilst taking your pictures just keep a GPS device running and carry it around with the camera. Once you are done, download the pictures and the GPS tracks, and run the above plugin. It will correlate the data in the time domain; so it is important that the camera be accurate in its clock setting (the GPS device is always accurate through the satellites). The positional accuracy interpolated from the track points can be as good as 20 meters. Of course, this approach only works if your camera can record EXIF data.

                When changes are made to JPEG files and they are saved back to the hard disk the JPEG file must be re-encoded. Each time a JPEG file is encoded a decision must be made on the level of quality that is to be applied. Unfortunately the level of quality applied is not recorded in the image file. This means that the Image Editor cannot use the same quality ratio when saving an altered image as was used for the original image. You can change the default level of quality that the Image Editor will apply when it saves altered images by moving the <guilabel>JPEG quality</guilabel> slider  (1: low quality / 100: high quality and no compression).

                <para><guilabel>Highlights</guilabel></para>
                <para>This is the story of the three highlight options, courtesy to <ulink url="http://linux.vilars.com/">Nicolas Vilars</ulink> :</para>
                <para>Default is here to consider highlights (read: part of your pictures that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the highlights) as plain / solid white (<guilabel>solid white</guilabel> option). You can get some fancy results with the <guilabel>unclip</guilabel> option which will paint the highlights in various pinks. At last you can try to consider recovering some parts of the missing information from the highlights (<guilabel>reconstruct</guilabel> option).</para>
                <para>
                  This is possible because the blue pixels tends to saturate less quickly than the greens and the reds. &digikam;/dcraw will try to reconstruct the missing green and red colors from the remaining none saturated blue pixels. Of course here everything is a question of tradeoff between how much color or white you want.</para>
                <para>If you select <guilabel>reconstruct</guilabel> as the option, you will be given the choice to set a level. A value of 3 is a compromise and can/should be adapted on a per picture basis.</para>
                <note><para>
                   A small warning here, for the few curious that have read the man pages of Dcraw, the author says that 5 is the compromise, 0 is solid white and 1 unclip. This is because in &digikam; 0 and 1 are the "solid white" and "unclip" options in the drop down menu (if you select these, the level slider will be grayed out). Therefore, the slider in Digikam with the "reconstruct" option will let you choose between 0 to 7 (instead of 0 to 9 in Dcraw command line) where 3 is the compromise instead of 5 in "native" Dcraw command line tool.</para></note>

                <para><guilabel>Brightness</guilabel> (works in 8 bit mode only)</para>
                <para>
                  Set the luminosity to your taste, you probably need to go a little higher than the default = 1. But this can be adjusted later with the image options in the Digikam image editor. Given the cost in time for demosaicing, stay conservative.
                </para>

                <para><guilabel>Quality</guilabel></para>
                <para>
                  A <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing">demosaicing</ulink> algorithm is a digital image process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</para>
                <para>
                  &digikam; and Dcraw offer us three alternatives: bi-linear, VNG interpolation, AHD interpolation. It seems that <emphasis>AHD interpolation</emphasis> (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) is the best choice for quality according to some test that I have performed and the paper of the person that implemented it. <emphasis>VNG interpolation</emphasis> (Variable Number of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw but suffers from color artifacts on the edge. <emphasis>Bilinear</emphasis> is interesting if you are looking for speed with a acceptable result.</para>

                 <para><guilabel>Enable Noise Reduction</guilabel></para>
                 <para>
                   While demosaicing your picture, you can additionally ask for noise reduction (at a speed penalty). This option applies a noise reduction algorithm while the picture still is in CIE Lab color space. Because the noise is only applied to the Luminosity layer (the "L" of the Lab), it should not blur your picture as traditional noise reduction algorithms do in RVB mode. So, if you converted an image from RAW and it appears noisy, rather than applying a denoiser, go back and re-convert with this option enabled. The defaults are: <emphasis>Domain</emphasis> = 2 and <emphasis>Range</emphasis> = 4.

              <para>
                 &digikam; has the ability to color manage your pictures. RAW files are not color managed at all. Your camera provides the data it has captured in a raw format and will let you manage all the processing. Every camera has its specifics regarding how it captures color information, therefore you will need to apply a specific profile to the pictures you want to process. Please refer to the section <link linkend="using-iccprofile">ICC color profile management</link> for more details an explanations.
              </para><para>
                 Basically, a profile "maps" the color information and gives information on how one should render them. It gives also information to LCMS and &digikam; on how to translate the color information from one color space to an other in order to keep the colors as accurate as possible.

                  You have to provide a workspace profile (such as Adobe RGB or sRGB).

However you may change this later of course, therefore Adobe RGB can be a good choice for storing and picture handling as you can always change it to sRGB before releasing a picture for your blog.</para></listitem>

                 There are some other options such as the soft proof profile which enables you to emulate, granted that you have a profile for it, how your picture will render for a particular device.

You may want to fix this manually instead of relying on the "blind" algorithm of your printer.</para></listitem>

            <para>
            &digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs and to make corrections and alterations. The Image Editor can be accessed either by clicking on a thumbnail in the Image Window or by right-clicking on a thumbnail and selecting <guilabel>View/Edit</guilabel> from the context menu.
            </para>

            <para>
            The Image Editor provides a number of tools that enable you to adjust a photograph. Some of these tools are provided by plugins to &digikam;. So they may not be available by default on your distribution. See the <link linkend="setupkipiplugins">Setup Image Editor Section</link> for more details about Kipi-plugins.

        <sect2>       <title>Restoring Your Original Photograph</title>

            <para>
            The editing functions of the Image Editor will make changes to your photograph. None of the editing functions will change the original photograph unless you select 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or click the <guilabel>Save</guilabel> button in the toolbar. Note that once you have saved the changed version you will not be able to recover the original photograph.
            </para>
        
            <para>
            You might prefer to take a copy of your photograph before you make any changes. You can use 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            to save a working copy.
            </para>
            
            <para>
            At any time <emphasis>before</emphasis> you save your photograph you can restore the view to the original image by selecting 
            <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
            or clicking the 
            <inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject><imagedata fileref="editorrevertbutton.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
                <textobject><phrase>The Image Editor Revert Button</phrase></textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
            <guilabel>Revert</guilabel> button on the toolbar. You will lose any changes that you have made to the photograph since it was last saved.
            </para>
            
        </sect2>

        <sect2>       <title>Undoing/Redoing Actions</title>
            
            <para>
            Almost anything you do to an image in Image Editor can be undone/redone. You can undo the most recent action by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, and redo by <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            </para>
            
            <para>
            If these are done so frequently that you really should memorize the keyboard shortcuts, <guilabel>&Ctrl;-Z</guilabel> to undoing action, and <guilabel>&Ctrl;-Shift-Z</guilabel> to redoing action.
            </para>

            <para>
            You have to press the &LMB; over the undo or redo icon in the toolbar and hold it down for a moment to produce a context menu. If you choose one of the menu items, all undo/redo actions until the chosen ones are undone/undone.

            <para>
            Once you have started the Image Editor you can move between photographs in the same Album or Tag view by using the navigator buttons on the toolbar or the entries in the <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu. If you have made any changes to the current photograph you will be asked if you want to save them.

            <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Toggle Full Screen</guimenuitem></menuchoice> will display the photograph using the full screen mode. You can move back to the normal view by pressing the <keycombo><keycap>Esc</keycap></keycombo> key. By default the toolbar is still displayed even in Full Screen Mode. If you would prefer that the toolbar is not displayed you can turn it off in the Configure &digikam; dialog accessed from the main &digikam; window, see the <link linkend="setup-editor">Setup Image Editor Section</link>.

            <para>
                What is the importance of ICC color profile management anyway? In simple terms it is alike hi-fi stereo, where high fidelity is seeked from source to speakers, passing through microphone, recoding media, player and amplifier. Much the same, ICC color profile management tries to maintain color fidelity from photographic subject through the camera to the output media screen, print, paper and beamer. Luckily digital photography has taken out one source of distortion, the storage media (as the &CD-ROM; did in the audio field).
            </para>

            <para>The figure below pictures the problem: Every time there is a transfer from one device to another, an ICC profile is used to correct for the inaccuracies or limitations of the device. The central work space (which is called Profile Connection Space, PCS) provides a common platform to translate the device color spaces into each other.

            </para>
            

            <tip>
                <para><emphasis>CM Pros.</emphasis> CM is really important whenever you need identical results between shooting sessions, accurate source reproduction, close rendering results between various display media (this would rather point CM to professionals).</para>
                <para>As a passionate amateur you can also profit from CM, since it is mostly associated with 16 bit color depth. RAW mode shooting is much more forgiving in terms of exposure than processed shooting (JPEG), so you can generally underexpose and recover the highlights. And, the human eye is much more sensitive to luminosity variations in the dark scales than a digital camera is. Careful tonal adjustment there close to the blacks will produce a better dynamic of the picture. That is why RAW mode pictures often have an appearance of more depth to them.</para>

                <para><emphasis>CM Cons.</emphasis> If you do not use color management you still can realize fantastic pictures. In journalism or emotional contexts, for holiday photos you do not need any color management.</para>
            </tip>

            <para>To configure &digikam; for ICC color management, please refer to the <link linkend="setup-iccprofiles">setup section.</link>
            </para>

            <para>
                The ICC standard covers a data format to exchange color information of devices. ISO 22028-1 specifies unambiguous exchange of color image data of color space encoding, viewing conditions, image state and reference medium. Here follows an example of the differences in color language: one kind of green defined (by the same numbers) in one color space looks different in another color space. This is what happens when no color management is applied.
            </para>
            <para>
              (88, 249, 16) in Adobe RGB <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="2Greens.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject> The same RGB value in sRGB.
            </para>

            <para>
                Photographers want to use the full gamut of their camera and their ink jet printers. Editing of pictures should be done in a work space, where equal RGB-numbers result into gray.

                <para> Soft Proofing is a way of previewing on the screen (monitor) the result to be expected from an output on another device, typically a printer. Soft proofing will show you the difference to be expected before you actually do it (and waste your costly ink). So you can improve your settings without wasting time and money.

                <para>Rendering intent refers to the way gamuts are handled when the intended target color space cannot handle the full gamut.</para>

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Perceptual</emphasis>, also called Picture or Maintain Full Gamut.  This is generally recommended for photographic images. The color gamut is expanded or compressed when moving between color spaces to maintain consistent overall appearance. Low saturation colors are changed very little. More saturated colors within the gamuts of both spaces may be altered to differentiate them from saturated colors outside the smaller gamut space. Perceptual rendering applies the same gamut compression to all images, even when the image contains no significant out-of-gamut colors.</para>
                    </listitem>

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Relative Colorimetric</emphasis>, also called Proof or Preserve Identical Color and White Point.  Reproduces in-gamut colors exactly and clips out-of-gamut colors to the nearest reproducible hue.</para>
                    </listitem>

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Absolute Colorimetric</emphasis>, also called Match or Preserve Identical Colors.  Reproduces in-gamut colors exactly and clips out-of-gamut colors to the nearest reproducible hue, sacrificing saturation and possibly lightness. On tinted papers, whites may be darkened to keep the hue identical to the original. For example, cyan may be added to the white of a cream-colored paper, effectively darkening the image. Rarely of interest to photographers.</para>
                    </listitem>

                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Saturation</emphasis>, also called Graphic or Preserve Saturation.  Maps the saturated primary colors in the source to saturated primary colors in the destination, neglecting differences in hue, saturation, or lightness. For block graphics; rarely of interest to photographers.</para>
