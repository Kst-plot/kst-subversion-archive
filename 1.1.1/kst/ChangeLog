2005-04-26 Tuesday 15:22  staikos

	disable time support in the ascii source for 1.1.0

2005-04-26 Tuesday 13:29  staikos

	add a static mechanism to determine if a source supports time.  Inefficient, but
	we have to wait for Kst2 for something better.  Fixes the vector dialog time
	support

2005-04-26 Tuesday 12:10  staikos

	mark new methods

2005-04-26 Tuesday 11:42  staikos

	revert const changes - this is a public interface.  We don't gain much from it
	so it's not worth duplicating the method.

2005-04-26 Tuesday 11:29  staikos

	mark new members

2005-04-25 Monday 23:56  staikos

	remove debug added recently

2005-04-25 Monday 23:41  staikos

	make time work the first time through

2005-04-25 Monday 22:43  staikos

	this seems to implement all that's needed for time support in the planck plugin.
	However it looks like time support needs more work inside Kst core still.

2005-04-24 Sunday 14:08  staikos

	add a good chunk of the code to create new data objects from the script side,
	where a piece of JS code is the logic of the object (basically slower plugins).
	It has to remain disabled right now because KJS doesn't provide a mechanism to
	give us a separate interpreter (for the thread) and make sure it doesn't race
	with the main one.

2005-04-23 Saturday 17:53  staikos

	Add a bit of a hack to fix fit labels, at least for the release.  I'm not sure
	it's a good idea to expose this as a public method.

	stat before attempting download, and don't rebuild the URL implicitly

2005-04-17 Sunday 11:28  staikos

	cleanup, add a warning when the Kst file is lying (and a safeguard), and add
	an update method

2005-04-16 Saturday 21:05  netterfield

	Add kstavectors, which are static vectors which can be modified, saved, and loaded.
	There is currently no UI for them, but they will be very useful in eg, scripting.

	They are saved, embedded in the XML, by
		fixing endianness using a qdatastream
		compressing
		base64 encoding.
	so they should be both reasonably storage efficient, and portable.

	There are now 4 kinds of vectors:
	RVectors: a field read from a data source, which updates with the data source.
	SVectors: a static vectors defined as N equally spaced points from x0 to x1.
	AVectors: a static, editable vector of N arbitrary points, which can be saved
			and loaded.
	Vectors: a base class vector is always a slave vector which gets its life and
		content from a data object, like the X axis in a psd.

2005-04-16 Saturday 12:17  staikos

	add configure check for kstcmd

	one more XBM wiped out.  9 PNGs to go

	note that line numbers start at 0

2005-04-15 Friday 11:23  staikos

	circumvent the KIO "storm" by adding a "Connect" button for remote URLs.
	I won't port this to the vector dialog until I receive feedback.  One of the
	nice things about this approach is that autocompletion works.  On the other
	hand, it requires extra user interaction.

2005-04-14 Thursday 23:56  staikos

	put the branchpoint at the right place, note that the beta release may happen
	as far away as Monday since 3 major issues and one minor issue are unresolved,
	and document who is responsible for each unresolved issue

2005-04-14 Thursday 23:53  staikos

	document our [half broken] collection of custom mimetypes.

2005-04-14 Thursday 19:44  staikos

	one dealt with, a new one discovered

2005-04-14 Thursday 19:43  staikos


	data sources need to be marked as non-reusable if the configuration changes
	since the user could:
	- load file v.txt
	- use v.txt
	- load file v.txt again, reconfigure
	- use v.txt
	- load file v.txt again
	- use v.txt

	In the second case, it needs to not save the changes to the datasource object,
	but create a new instance, mark the old one as non-reusable, and apply the
	settings to the new instance.  The third case needs to pick up the instance
	created in the second load, not the first.

	This doesn't cover the "reload" case.  The problem is that reset() is not
	implemented in most datasources so reloading will cause all new instances to
	be created.  This needs to be fixed ASAP.

2005-04-14 Thursday 14:49  staikos

	BUG: 103849

2005-04-13 Wednesday 22:08  staikos

	Fix enabled status of the vector dialog.  Patch also contains some changes
	related to the KIO problem, but doesn't fix it.
	BUG: 103848

	docs updates

2005-04-13 Wednesday 21:54  staikos

	finish fixed-field-widths

2005-04-13 Wednesday 21:02  staikos

	add a new static symbol so that data sources can load settings.  Make the ascii
	source load its settings.

2005-04-13 Wednesday 19:24  staikos

	save and load settings to the Kst file.  Problem: we have no mechanism to ask
	the source plugin to load yet.  I think I have to use the virtual hook for this.

2005-04-13 Wednesday 14:05  staikos

	we support KIO...

2005-04-13 Wednesday 13:59  staikos

	- fix numerous regressions related to KIO integration.  one remains (it creates
	  a KIO storm)
	- enable/disable the OK button based on whether we can create a vector or not.
	  the same goes for the Field combo.  There is a bit of flicker in the Field
	  combo still

2005-04-13 Wednesday 13:14  staikos

	should be the rest of the regressions here

2005-04-13 Wednesday 12:55  staikos

	fix some cases of empty files not working - more to go, but they're even older
	regressions than those from today.

2005-04-13 Wednesday 12:40  staikos

	one thing missed and it propagates all over the place.  remove unnecessary
	virtuals

2005-04-13 Wednesday 12:35  staikos

	implement header skip - causes some minor regressions that I'm fixing now

2005-04-13 Wednesday 05:03  hasso

	Compile, please.

2005-04-13 Wednesday 02:14  staikos

	remove warnings, and don't clear the fieldlist because if the field list changed
	then the row index is almost certainly wrong anyway, and we don't really support
	such changing files

2005-04-13 Wednesday 01:43  staikos

	implement all of the new ascii options except:
	- extraction of field names in fixed field mode
	- header skip in readField()

2005-04-13 Wednesday 00:52  staikos

	add UI and saving and loading of the last of Nicolas' patches, minus the units.
	We don't have a generic mechanism for units and I don't like the field names
	it produces (they're non-standard for Kst).  For 1.2 we can try to add a proper
	units mechanism to datasources.  The implementation of these options will
	happen later, but it's important to get the strings in early.

2005-04-13 Wednesday 00:11  staikos

	another issue that has to be dealt with for 1.1.0

2005-04-12 Tuesday 23:17  staikos

	need configure checks

2005-04-12 Tuesday 22:28  staikos

	The object layout for plugins seems to work.  However there is still quite a bit
	of work to be done in adding properties and functions.

2005-04-12 Tuesday 21:06  arwalker

	Added ability to define a cursor position within a plot by hitting the 'C' button (Hit SHIFT+'C" to remove the cursor). Once a cursor is set the status bar will show the offset from the cursor position to the current mouse position. This functionality also works in data mode.

	Do we want to add an item to the context menu for this?

	CCMAIL: 98564@bugs.kde.org

2005-04-12 Tuesday 13:04  staikos

	pay attention and commit all the files :)

2005-04-12 Tuesday 12:49  staikos

	add binding for legends - only allows to enable/disable and move front<->back.
	legends become kstshared.

2005-04-12 Tuesday 10:33  staikos

	that's not supposed to be there

2005-04-12 Tuesday 00:14  staikos

	symbol in debug builds.

2005-04-11 Monday 22:39  staikos

	revertlast - has to be included everywhere

2005-04-11 Monday 22:36  staikos

	make sure jsbinding.h is always included

2005-04-11 Monday 22:00  staikos

	wow, didn't mean to commit that.

2005-04-11 Monday 21:55  staikos

	add bindings to the extension manager so scripts can load, unload, or query

2005-04-11 Monday 17:18  staikos

	add bindings for kstcolorsequence

2005-04-11 Monday 09:39  staikos

	factor regexp creation out of the loop

2005-04-11 Monday 09:25  staikos

	this should finish up the data formatting section of ascii settings.  There is
	no detection code for Fixed Width Columns though.  Nicolas' did not have any
	such code either.

2005-04-11 Monday 01:55  staikos

	make the config dialog work properly from the data wizard

2005-04-11 Monday 01:34  staikos

	update the dialog when config is changed

2005-04-11 Monday 01:29  staikos

	Make sure the dialog gets a pointer to the data source when opening it.  The
	data wizard probably has the same problem.  This dialog also needs to be updated
	when a save happens since the field list could change.

2005-04-10 Sunday 23:37  staikos

	config options are closer to working now - still some issues to work out

2005-04-10 Sunday 21:36  staikos

	- implement much of the code for the data formatting options
	- optimize: reduce malloc calls

2005-04-10 Sunday 19:22  staikos

	Add UI for Nicolas' "Data Formatting" options, and loading code.  Still
	inactive.

2005-04-10 Sunday 18:48  staikos

	Merge the first of Nicolas' patches, untested.  Adds support for a wildcard
	expression that indicates that it is for sure an ascii file.  Changes: uses
	100% instead of 90%.  90% seems to partially defeat the purpose of the feature.

2005-04-10 Sunday 17:51  staikos

2005-03-16 Wednesday 10:32  staikos

	proposed changes to the update counter

2005-03-15 Tuesday 20:19  staikos

	first big benefit of new update scheme: plugins only update when their
	dependencies update now.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 19:43  staikos

	Well we still need these anyway, so let's leave them here.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 19:08  staikos

	Only update when dependencies update or when forced to update

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:56  staikos

	rework update to not trigger if the input vector isn't updated and a force
	doesn't happen.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:36  staikos

	force a crash (assert) when size=0 happens so we can trace it down.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:35  staikos

	Fix two mistakes in previous commit:
	1) updating the equation now updates the vectors used so we don't need to do it
	explicitly (although no harm...)
	2) xVector update was not happening

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:17  arwalker

	Prevent a crash that results when trying to draw into a null pixmap. This can happen when a plot takes up either zero width or zero height in a window.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:11  staikos

	rework equation update:
	1) update VectorsUsed first (!!)
	2) only FillY when the vectors used have changed, the x vector has changed, or
	a forced update happens
	3) Return a proper return code

2005-03-15 Tuesday 18:04  arwalker

	Limit number of columns to the same number as is supported in the user interface (i.e. 10).

2005-03-15 Tuesday 17:02  arwalker

	Obsolete

2005-03-15 Tuesday 17:02  arwalker

	Allow drag and drop between windows.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 15:22  staikos

	- fix indenting in KstHistogram::update() (remove tabs, etc)
	- implement the cached update result as best as can be done without reworking
	the update algorithms
	- implement KstViewObject::update
	- de-inline some virtual methods and add setDirty() to them (much more work to
	do here)

	This amounts to almost nothing visible, but I'm committing now in the interest
	of making changes incrementally.

2005-03-15 Tuesday 14:53  staikos

	The root of my frustrations with update() right now

2005-03-15 Tuesday 14:11  arwalker

	Add ability to copy a single plot to the clipboard from the layout popup menu.

2005-03-14 Monday 20:33  arwalker

	Allow the user to use copy and paste plots using the clipboard. The copy functionality operates only on selected plots in layout mode. The paste functionality operaties only in layout mode.

2005-03-14 Monday 15:23  staikos

	add d pointer implementation and two variables for use in the update reworking

2005-03-14 Monday 14:57  staikos

	some more details

2005-03-13 Sunday 21:28  staikos

	forgot to add this before

2005-03-11 Friday 19:17  arwalker

	Enable timezone settings for KDE dates.

2005-03-11 Friday 19:08  arwalker

	Implement support for KDE formatted dates and times.

	CCMAIL: 101130-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-11 Friday 16:13  staikos

	just to clarify

2005-03-11 Friday 15:40  staikos

	re-enable compile of KJS extension

2005-03-11 Friday 15:23  staikos

	3.1

2005-03-11 Friday 15:13  staikos

	er something didn't sound right

2005-03-11 Friday 15:13  staikos

	fail on editable scalars

2005-03-11 Friday 15:03  staikos

	restore indenting and remove commented code that was moved to .ui file to avoid
	confusion

2005-03-11 Friday 14:45  staikos

	revertlast, re-apply relevant portion of patch

2005-03-11 Friday 14:40  arwalker

	Make resize more elegantly and make borders consistent with other UI elements.

2005-03-11 Friday 14:08  arwalker

	Add ability to quickly copy a plot from one window to another in layout mode.

2005-03-11 Friday 14:07  arwalker

	Indentation correction. Barth, any possibilty you could get your editor to replace tabs with spaces.

2005-03-11 Friday 13:56  staikos

	notes on the plan for modifying updates

2005-03-11 Friday 13:56  staikos

	major work on scripting - a new console is created which can be run inside or
	outside of Kst, along with descriptions of bindings and some minor reworkings

2005-03-11 Friday 12:12  netterfield

	BUG:
	Parent the window name dialog so data object dialogs don't get burried

	Add default histogram labels

	Improve psd labels

	Make default plot names from command line consistent with other naming
	schemes

2005-03-10 Thursday 17:53  arwalker

	Make compatible with KDE 3.1

	CVS_SILENT

2005-03-10 Thursday 17:46  arwalker

	CCMAIL: 95031-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-10 Thursday 16:14  arwalker

	Couldn't find these in CVS already.

2005-03-10 Thursday 15:43  arwalker

	Remove duplicate connections causing scalar text to be added twice to event monitor.

2005-03-10 Thursday 14:51  mueller

	go away

2005-03-10 Thursday 14:44  arwalker

	Correct indentation.

2005-03-10 Thursday 14:26  arwalker

	When run from the command line, if curves are created one per plot, then label the plots P<n>-<y> where <n> is some integer (as before) and <y> is the name of the y-vector in some simple curve. All other cases remain as before.

	CCMAIL: 94346-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-10 Thursday 13:36  arwalker

	KCalendarSystem obsolete

2005-03-10 Thursday 13:18  arwalker

	Try and fail more gracefully if files or vectors do not exist. Report these problems to the user through KstDebug.

2005-03-10 Thursday 08:53  adridg

	Workarounds for inconsistent include path handling in various headers; immediate trigger was kmdichildview.h:42:32: kst/k
	st/kst_export.h: No such file or directory

2005-03-09 Wednesday 22:42  netterfield

	CONST_PI now uses M_PI in math.h
	Add a couple more constants useful for deg to radian conversions.

2005-03-09 Wednesday 11:02  netterfield

	Script definition cleanup.

2005-03-09 Wednesday 06:24  netterfield

	-Add a new autoscale mode which leaves a 5% border - this is now the
		what 'm' gives you in Y.
	-Fix data wizard tracking of regid settings for windows.

2005-03-08 Tuesday 20:07  arwalker

	Added ability to define timezone for time-interpreted axes that are displayed as dates.

2005-03-08 Tuesday 16:17  staikos

	notes about scripting, and an example

2005-03-07 Monday 16:47  arwalker

	Added "sticky" borders when resizing. Reduced the distance to stick by half. Implemented as per some sort of vague consensus.

	CCMAIL: 85732-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-07 Monday 15:40  arwalker

	Fix a problem when resizing a plot, that could cause overlapping text because the internalAlignment algorithm was using the cached font sizes, rather than the new font sizes.

2005-03-07 Monday 15:01  arwalker

	Correct indentation

2005-03-07 Monday 04:05  scripty

	CVS_SILENT made messages (.desktop file)

2005-03-06 Sunday 09:28  adridg

	--enable-final: identifiers need to be unique across object files too; the static QString looks scary and superfluous anyway -- what about making it non-static, like the one in for fit?

2005-03-05 Saturday 16:29  netterfield

	New rules for default labels for curves:
	-get rid of file name in top label - it is generally not useful.
	-For 1-3 curves, v->label() in Y axes, otherwise, default to legend box on.

2005-03-05 Saturday 08:56  netterfield

	Some changes to auto-labels for PSD's;

2005-03-04 Friday 18:18  netterfield

	Revert to Andrew's original fix, but leave 1.25 * line spacing...

2005-03-04 Friday 17:58  arwalker

	Implement sticky borders.

	Do we want to make it configurable (switch on/off, distance to snap, etc.)?
	Do we also want it to apply to resizing, or just moving, as requested in the bug report?

	CCMAIL: 85732@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-04 Friday 17:51  netterfield

	The position of the X axis should have nothing to do with the height of
	the Y Tick labels.

	We need to add 1.5 x YLabel height for 1.5 line spacing, which I think looks nice.

2005-03-04 Friday 14:48  netterfield

	Changing the #plot cols selects re-grid
	Add icons for new events, images, and plugins.

2005-03-04 Friday 14:17  arwalker

	We want to remember the line width even if lines are disabled as the line width (now called weight) also impacts the point size. Also, we want to store line and point settings (even if not currently used) as they still give the last used setting, which the user might want to retain across sessions.

	CCMAIL: 98560-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-03 Thursday 21:34  arwalker

	Clean up the x-axis and y-axis labels. Should also prevent overlapping of labels on the x-axis.

	97395_done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-03 Thursday 18:28  arwalker

	Better handle drawing of histogram lines when the width is greater than 0.

2005-03-03 Thursday 18:00  arwalker

	Previously the min/max values for the histogram properties would be incorrectly reported as they did not account for the width of a bar. Thus, if you opened the Edit Histogram dialog and hit OK the min/max values would change even though you hadn't modified any values. This has been fixed.

	CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 Thursday 17:05  staikos

	The reason they're deprecated is because they don't associate their dialogs
	with the caller widget.  0L just circumvents the warning without fixing the
	problem.  Unfortunately it can't be fixed in kstdatasource at this point
	because it's part of the library.  Will solve this later with a static of some
	sort.

2005-03-03 Thursday 14:53  arwalker

	Handle deprecated mehods.

2005-03-03 Thursday 14:38  arwalker

	Keep compatibility with earlier versions of KDE.

	CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 Thursday 14:32  arwalker

	Handle some more deprecated methods.

2005-03-03 Thursday 14:15  arwalker

	Requires kdeversion.h

2005-03-03 Thursday 13:52  arwalker

	KLineEditDlg has been deprecated.

	CVS_SILENT

2005-03-03 Thursday 12:20  arwalker

	More efficient when axis in date interpreted mode.

2005-03-03 Thursday 11:55  arwalker

	Sort the legend alignment in the more logical left, center, right order.

2005-03-03 Thursday 00:27  staikos

	Another place where comment delimiters were hardcoded, and significantly
	reduce the readField loop in cpu cycles (one less condition, and no memset())

2005-03-02 Wednesday 23:56  arwalker

	Required for icons in data manager.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 23:51  arwalker

	Add icons to the New... buttons to make things more consistent.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 23:47  staikos

	cleanup KstScalar for future work

2005-03-02 Wednesday 22:33  arwalker

	Y axis interpretation changes.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 20:22  staikos

	ah, also don't permit the user to even try to use stdin in this dialog

2005-03-02 Wednesday 19:28  staikos

	data wizard with stdin doesn't really make sense

2005-03-02 Wednesday 19:21  staikos

	use KstSettings for printer settings, and remove obsolete delay code.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 18:52  staikos

	no longer true due to previous fixes

2005-03-02 Wednesday 18:46  staikos

	add support for functions with != 1 argument, but we don't have any, so they're
	unused.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 18:31  staikos

	refactor to eliminate two copies of the interpolation code.  It's not what I
	would call pretty, but at least there's no chance of any performance hit.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 18:04  staikos

	add a Negative node so that printing out the tree is "pretty"

2005-03-02 Wednesday 17:36  staikos

	match changes in the parser

2005-03-02 Wednesday 17:36  staikos

	equation objects now automatically detect changes in vector names and rewrite
	the equation accordingly.  Some formatting is lost, but in general it seems to
	work.  Causes a small performance hit on saving equations since they are
	reparsed and then the tree is walked.

	Required changing collectVectors to use a map instead of a list.

	Negatives are temporarily a bit broken

2005-03-02 Wednesday 17:34  arwalker

	Integrate histograms and psds better into the delayed loading mechanism.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 17:07  arwalker

	Don't bother to update an invalid object as we're about to delete it.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 16:52  staikos

	spacing in debug message

2005-03-02 Wednesday 16:24  arwalker

	KStaticDeleter::setObject(type *obj, bool isArray = false ) is deprecated.

2005-03-02 Wednesday 15:21  arwalker

	Add ability to specify time interpretation on the y-axis.

	96761-done@bugs.kde.org

2005-03-01 Tuesday 21:33  staikos

	iteration works better this way

2005-03-01 Tuesday 21:32  staikos

	added another testcase, updated results

2005-03-01 Tuesday 21:26  staikos

	nodes now keep track of parentheses (collapsed to one at most) and spit them out
	in text() where needed.  (-x) is broken -> gives (0-x).  May need to introduce
	a negative node to fix this properly.

	also fixed parser to work with bison 1.875

2005-03-01 Tuesday 19:36  staikos

	This flattens equations to text, but there are two problems:
	1) whitespace is lost (minor)
	2) parentheses are lost (major)

	Solutions seem to be:
	i) make a tree walker instead and have it know about order of operations,
	inserting parentheses where needed (painful)
	ii) store parentheses flag in each node (somewhat heavy)

2005-03-01 Tuesday 19:21  arwalker

	Cleanup.

	CVS_SILENT

	or on the axes in a plot.  This fixes that.

2005-02-28 Monday 16:10  netterfield

	More changes to tag naming.  In particular, preserve "-sv" suffixes which were
	set in 1.0.0.

2005-02-27 Sunday 20:27  mueller

	fix visibility

2005-02-24 Thursday 13:26  staikos

	more work on time including some fixes, and rudimentary support in ascii files.
	you can now take an ascii file with INDEX assumed to be 0s...ns and ask for
	starting at "3 minutes" or last "1 hour"

2005-02-08 Tuesday 11:05  staikos

	Remember the last active window and restore it.  Remembers it with a node in
	<windowsize> which maybe isn't completely ideal, but it's easier than storing
	an <active/> node in the window since that would require iterating through the
	windows and storing a flag, or walking the XML again.  Maybe we'll get to clean
	the XML up one day and fix this then.

	This is a bit of a fix for updating of hidden tabs.  It avoids painting or
	drawing tabs that aren't visible.  It may be buggy so feedback is appreciated.
	This stuff is very complex.  Updating of data objects that are "hidden" still
	happens since we don't really know what is or is not hidden in the update
	thread.  It also requires much more complex dependency walking than we are even
	capable of doing right now.  I am going to close the bug as fixed and leave the
	rest as "LATER" to be part of update redesign.  Reopen if tabs are still being
	painted when they shouldn't be, or if this fix breaks things.

	BUG: 95211

	After recent changes, the renderer was sometimes using the bounding
	box of "0123456789" for height, and sometimes using height = ascent +
	decent +1 for height...  This uses the latter definition for all cases.
	So now, top alignment is with the top of the highest accent allowed in the
	font, and bottom alignment is with the lowest decender.

	This has additionally required some re-tweaking of kst2dplot label placement.
	Still more could be useful, but not tonight.

2004-12-15 Wednesday 14:01  netterfield

	On loading from a kst file we were getting three re-draws of the plots:
	1) empty plots - really fast and makes loading seem more friendly
	2) an explicit re-draw in  KstDoc::newDocument
	3) a third one triggered (I think) by the update system (it is after we
	exit  KstDoc::newDocument and is delayed if update timer is set really long.

	#2 didn't seem to show, and doesn't seem to accomplish anything, since #3
	happens anyway. #2 doesn't work anyway, because it doesn't appear to deal
	correctly with axis allignment (it works plot by plot, and not on the whole
	tlv, so if a redraw is not required, it is by luck.)  But I could be wrong here.

	This patch gets rid of #2, and does not appear to have any negative side
	side effects, but speeds things up in loading a long plot.

	This program attempts to benchmark the qt/X calls used by kst, to see if your
	graphics card is a bottleneck to performance.

	To make it,
	qmake -project
	qmake
	make

	Typical kst screen updates are 1-5 Hz, so anything over 20Hz is fine.
	The xorg or XFree drivers are ~20% faster in this bench than the ATI binaries.
	I have not checked NVIDIA's drivers.

	You can expect
	ATI 9600: ~30 Hz
	NVidia G4 ~35 Hz
	ATI 9800: ~50 Hz
	ATI 8500: ~30 Hz

	S3 on board: 2-6 Hz
	Laptop Radeons: 12 Hz - 25 Hz, depending on model and driver.

	As with all benchmarks, make sure nothing else is running.

	In some cases I have found terrible performance, even though nothing else
	was running.  Restarting the X server fixed it.  Not sure why....

2004-12-09 Thursday 17:20  arwalker

	Better calculate the tick positions. Previously RelPlotRegion.width()/height() was used to determine the scale. This is incorrect as if the height is, for example, 100 then we want to scale by one less than this. If we draw to rows 0 and 100 then this will actually exceed the RelPlotRegion by one pixel, as RelPlotRegion is confined from pixels 0 to 99.

	Possibly found a cause of Kst not cleaning up properly on exit.  I think the

	two more dialog calls migrated

2004-11-24 Wednesday 19:26  staikos

	- updated eqparser test

2004-11-24 Wednesday 18:54  staikos

	Add the start of a (presently useless) histogram test, and make libkstmath
	completely self-contained.  This requires us to separate the dialog launching
	code out of data objects and into the libkstguiapp / nonguiapp helpers.

	Updated the test template.

2004-11-24 Wednesday 18:05  staikos

	added a template for testcases along with a header file and ported eqparser
	tests to use it

2004-11-22 Monday 13:40  staikos

	add a plugin test -> pushes coverage of the interpreter to ~90%, and basically

2004-11-22 Monday 13:05  staikos

	Now have coverage of entire scanner and parser (minus error paths, multiple

2004-11-22 Monday 12:28  staikos

	Bug in the optimizer - it doesn't optimize the toplevel node in the tree.  Not

	Datasource patch approved by Barth, to be implemented later.  Used for making
	skip more efficient for some.

2004-11-12 Friday 11:17  staikos

	Make document loading appear to be completely asynchronous.  I don't feel
	entirely comfortable with this patch yet, but it seems to work well enough to
	use here, and the long delay on loading is a major issue.  Here's how it works:

	1) openDocument() is guarded against reentrancy.  It just fails in KstDoc if
	you call it while it's running already. (maybe silently)
	2) DCOP is disabled while opening a document to avoid reentrancy and races.
	3) events up to 10ms are processed in the loading loop
	4) the document does at sometimes exist in an invalid state
	5) the user can shoot his own foot by deleting objects while the document is
	   loading.  Too bad. (A solution is to add a read-only lock during loading
	   but this is very messy I think.)
	6) We hope that I haven't missed any possible events that can cause a
	   reentrance somehow
	7) We slowly offload more of this updating onto the update thread from KstDoc
	   in the future.

2004-11-12 Friday 10:41  staikos

	seems to be the best solution for this broken environment

	major bugfix: plugin combo is disabled for new plugins after trying to edit a
	plugin that's in use.

2004-11-10 Wednesday 07:22  staikos

	The big patch<tm>
	-------------

	1) Fix missing periods in messageboxes from fft widget
	2) Add support for a PSD divisor, that cuts the PSD update rate to a given
	   fraction of the plot update rate.  Huge CPU bonus here.
	3) Greatly simplify the code for the FFT widget and move stuff from the .ui.h
	   to the .ui
	4) Spinboxes: use .value(), not .text().toInt().
	5) Adjust the update algorithm to update data objects during pause, which is
	   for the most part just empty updates that immediately return.  This is
	   needed to make sure that PSDs get their timeslice.
	6) Adjust PSD and plugin update to not update when not needed.
	7) KstRVector sets NumNew=0 when an update is called and no new data is there.
	8) Indent fft options header to designer-style.

	Should we move this divisor concept into KstObject instead?  It seems
	generically useful.  It's all of one variable and two non-virtual methods,
	which could be added after 1.0, but it will require using the d-pointer so
	soon in the case of the member variable.

2004-11-10 Wednesday 05:36  staikos

	- Show "Plot: tagname" in title instead of "tagname" because it can be
	  confusing what the context of the context menu is
	  menuTitle() virtual function added to view objects for this.
	- Put Edit.. before Delete to avoid accidents
	- Don't show the plot context menu in label mode.  It's confusing.  This will
	  eventually be unnecessary when we have viewobject based labels.

	BUG:

	Adding optional parameters in BIT fields means that comments at the end of

2004-11-07 Sunday 18:37  arwalker

	Always use 0 or 10 minor ticks for default value for minor ticks when in log mode.

	If you are in log mode and the data range is too small (i.e. log(range) < 2) then you really shouldn't be in log mode. Under these conditions you can either give minor ticks at regular intervals which are seemingly random numbers, or minor ticks at irrgeular intervals which are round numbers. Neither is very satisfactory. As a result the current behaviour has been left unchanged.

	Also, fixed a problem where some major ticks were not displayed in log mode.

	Do we want to check this into HEAD?

2004-11-03 Wednesday 10:38  netterfield

	BUG:

	As pointing out a while ago by Andrew, a change I made to allow empty *Labels
	to take up no room if they are empty also changed the way labels are handled
	in terms of what the correct justification should be. Since, up to now, the
	Justification of these otherwise fixed labels is stored in data file, this
	change meant that old files (August and earlier) request the wrong
	justification for the labels.

	This patch does 2 things to the way that [X|Y|Tick]*Labels are handled.
	1) it assumes that the position of these labels is fixed, and overwrites
	whatever justification might have been in the file.
	2) it assumes that since neither the position nor the justification for these
	labels is going to be listened to, it shouldn't write them to the file.

	It means that kst files written by new versions of kst will not work on old
	ksts, but old kst files will work on new ksts.

	      of foo(), along with specifying the default argument explicitly
	   b) bug in the cleanup() algorithm

2004-10-31 Sunday 17:34  staikos

	add datasource configuration support to the vector dialog, and an example with
	the ascii source.  data wizard still needs to earn this button.

	There is a bit of a logic problem remaining with this.  It's conceivable that
	the user needs to configure the data source before he can read his file, but
	the configuration can't be accessed until a data source is found that can read
	the file.  I think we need to add datasource configuration elsewhere also.
	This is a pre-1.0 issue.

2004-10-31 Sunday 16:14  staikos

	data source type is displayed in the wizard

2004-10-31 Sunday 15:31  staikos

	  different on next launch.

2004-10-28 Thursday 23:27  staikos

	store files in the history as absolute paths so that launching Kst from other

	Add the ability to interpret the x-axis values as various time formats, and display in another time format.

	This is only a display of the concept at this point and the following issues need to be addressed:

	* tick positioning
	* permissible range of data
	* reported position (for cursor and nearest data point)

	In all of the above the algorithms use the raw data values, where they should be using/displaying the converted time values.

	I will await comments before proceeding to fix this issues.

	Switch the position of the top and x-axis sample label so that the sample labels are read in the same order (left to right, top to bottom) as the labels are edited (top to bottom).

2004-10-04 Monday 20:32  arwalker

	Fix problems with the absolute values displayed on the x-axis and y-axis.

	Originally if the range of the x-axis or y-axis became too small to display the axis values in a reasonable amount of space an absolute value would be displayed to the right or above (for the y and x-axis respecitively) the axis label, with delta values on the axes themselves.

	A subsequent modification reduced the usefulness of this, by putting the label and absolute value at the same position, but with the label centred and the absolute value left justified. However, this was only helpful when the two did not overlap (which was seldom for anything but a single plot in a large window).

	These changes now use the former method when the two would otherwise overlap, and the latter when there is sufficient room to display them on the same line. At the same time it fixes some problems introduced by the first change when the font sizes for the label and asolute value were not the same.

	Further ensure that we update the PSD of a plugin output vector if the data file was changed on any of the input vectors. This was previously not happening, unless the new vector happened to be significantly longer than the old vector.

2004-09-01 Wednesday 17:39  arwalker

	If we have changed data files then make sure we recalculate any PSDs. If the number of samples if equal to the number of new samples then its safe to assume that the data file was changed, and so we recalculate the PSD. Previously this was not happening and so the PSD would remain the PSD of the old vector data.

2004-09-01 Wednesday 16:46  arwalker

	This fixes (partially) a problem reported by MAMD.

	A PSD is only relcalculated if the number of new points is >= the current PSD length / 16.
	For plugin output vectors this new length was always zero, so the PSD would never be
	recalculated. This has now been fixed, but the PSD will still not be recalculated unless the
	condition described above is satisfied.

	Jeff Klien found a critical real time bug (race condition) in which
	a plot repaint could (and would) happen after the X vector had been
	but before the Y vector had been updated, leading to an inconsistent plot.

	This fixes this, by (and at the cost of) not letting the update thread
	do any processing until the UI thread is finished painting.  This does not
	influence the responsiveness of the UI, and has little or no performance
	penalty for a single CPU sustem, but does slow things down on the
	multi-cpu system.  There are few, if any, other options, however.

	86582 emulated in tied zoom mode.  Discussion?

2004-08-19 Thursday 16:55  rchern

	Plot marker jumping behaviour in tied zoom mode has been changed.  Main differences:
	- jumping to a marker will cause all other tied plots to center on the same x value.  The x zoom level is not changed, consistent with scrolling behaviour
	- if a tied plot (that is not the active plot) is in log mode, it will not jump at all if asked to jump to a non-positive center, but all other tied plots will try to jump (if they can)
	- if the active plot is unable to jump (no marker available, or negative plot marker in xLog mode) then other tied plots will not jump either, even if they are able to.

	The last two points make it possible to have unsynchronized jumps when in tied zoom mode.

	This should be like "sharing" plot markers (the markers themselves are not shared, however).

	Added another unused virtual method to determine if the object is valid or not.
	The idea is that when an object has an internal issue (failed large malloc, loss
	of data file, etc), it should be able to get marked as "bad", visible in the
	data manager, and then purge could [optionally?] remove the bad objects
	recursively.

	A complete audit of all the dialogs except data manager and data wizard, which
	should have already been auditted (and I have checked them in the recent past).
	- most importantly, all locking should be fixed
	- inefficiencies removed
	- warnings removed
	- formatting fixed
	- dead code removed
	- unused variables removed
	- some unnecessary headers removed (many more lurking)
	- many i18n fixes

	Please test thoroughly.  This was a huge task and fully testing it just isn't a
	simple procedure.  Also KstImageDialog had merge conflicts which I merged
	manually.  Rick, you might want to review those changes to make sure I didn't
	make any mistakes.

2004-08-05 Thursday 17:12  staikos

	Fix the ugly, ugly, ugly locking bug discovered by Barth.  It goes like this:
	DataObject contains maps, and locking data object locks all objects inside its
	maps.  set*Vector() methods in KstEquationCurve remove an item from the map
	and add a new one.  the old one gets deleted (in the best case -- in the worst
	case it doesn't and we have a permanently locked object) and then the new one
	is inserted - unlocked.  Therefore when we unlock() the dataobject, it tries
	to unlock the new vector, which isn't locked.  This fix hacks around the
	problem, but we need a real solution because this can get really messy really
	quickly.

2004-08-05 Thursday 16:02  staikos

	dead code removal, and reparse the equation immediately in setEquation() so we

2004-08-05 Thursday 14:18  staikos

	add a new static helper to KstDataSource: fieldListForSource()

	If this is implemented in the datasource plugin, it will give us a short-path
	to getting the field list for autocompletion.  it remains to be seen if this
	will make other sources inefficient, but it should help with some anyway.

2004-08-05 Thursday 13:48  staikos

	remove the Plot Position spinbox.  I tried to implement it again but it really
	doesn't make much sense anymore since:
	1) it refers to 2d space and we have 3d space now (z-order)
	2) we have multiple windows
	3) we have free layout capabilities
	4) implementing it requires all kinds of tricky geometry work now
	5) most of the time it has to be disabled because it's not applicable

2004-08-05 Thursday 12:31  staikos

	some minor plotgroup fixes, and make it visible that a plotgroup has the focus
	or is selected.  Previously the selection and focus rects were not
	distinguisable from the border in many cases, and this will become more of a
	problem when we make the border color configurable.  A good solution for now is
	to hide the border as it becomes very clear that something has 'happened' and
	the focus or selection rects are also very clear at that point.

	In the drawing function keep everything in double precision as long as possible.

	If this is not done then zooming in to a very small region in x, relative to the seperation in points, causes no line to be drawn when it should be. This results from double values getting incorrectly cast to integer values as the double value is too large in absolute value to be represented by an integer.

	Fix problems with labels (86118). If the text, size, etc. associated with a label was modified then the width would be explicitly recalculated, else it would be recalculated on every draw operation. With the axes labels the cached Width property of the label would not be set as invalid (-1) so the old Width would be assumed to be valid, which was not true following a resize operation on a plot. We now explicitly invalidate the old label Width.

	Dragging of multi-line text now works.
		-There are DnD problems with rotated text (seems like a previous bug)
		-Line spacing takes no account of super and sub scripts (wontfix)

	Since this is just a hack until viewlabels are implemented, I'm not inclined to
	do much more on it.

2004-07-28 Wednesday 10:07  netterfield

	Start at new lines in labels.
	  - '\n' in a label adds a new line
	  - Greek replacement hapens first, so in 'the \nuser' \nu will be interpreted
		as as the greek letter nu.
	  - a space after a \n will be ignored, so in 'the \n user' '\n ' will be a new line,
		not a new line followed by a space.

	As this point, static endering of the multi line label seems to work, but rendering
	of the label during dragging seems messed up.

	First shot at adding 'frameNum' scalar for data sources:
		-Binary compatibility is maintained: I used *d.
			Do we want to bother since it isn't promised yet?
		-It requires a call to updateNumFrameScalar() from update in
		the plugins, or it stays at 0.  I have modified all existing
		plugins to do this.

		-This has uncovered a ... bug: data sources get created by browsing with
		the dialogs, but never get deleted or purged.  I think an auto-purge is
		in order.  Not sure where or how yet.

	Keep plot marker list sorted and add some empty functions for scrolling to marks

2004-07-14 Wednesday 21:17  arwalker

	This removes additional redraws that would happen every time a plot was printed or exported.
	The technique now is to modify all the values of _geom more carefully, so that before and after the print/export operation they are guarenteed to be the same, which gets rid of the need for a redraw.

	The only problem encountered was with kst2dPlot::xInternalAlignment() which would reduce the size of the back-buffer every time a repaint is done. During printing this would cause the buffer to shrink in size, and so not all of the plot would be subsequently redrawn following the print. I addressed this by not calling xInternalAlignment() during a print or export operation.

2004-07-13 Tuesday 19:12  arwalker

	Framework for display the parameter names of a fit.

	At present these names will not get translated as they reside in the plugin, which does not have access to Qt.

	The parameter names are acquired through a function (rather than e.g. putting them in the xml) as some of the fits have a variable number of parameters, which depend on some input scalar. Thus, the parameter names must be calculated dynamically.

2004-07-07 Wednesday 11:40  netterfield

	Some minor ui improvements aimed at reducing mouse clicks:
	  curve placement choice is now a radio box
		-you have to place a curve
		-you can only place it in one place with this dialog
	    but: there are fewer mouse clicks in the common cases.
	  You can chose to add a curve to a plot even if there are no windows yet.  If you do,
	    a new window with the default name (W1) will be made.
	  If no vectors have been made, vectordialog default prompt is INDEX.

2004-07-07 Wednesday 00:13  netterfield

2004-06-05 Saturday 13:18  staikos

	I see no reason to remove this type - all other objects have it for consistency

2004-06-05 Saturday 13:01  arwalker

	I have reverted the reversions. The change I made was correct.

	The problem was that KstSharedPtr was not checking the correct
	values for the deletion of an object. As a result once any
	KstSharedPtr object was created it was never destroyed.

	You can confirm this by placing a breakpoint on the destructor
	of objects like KstVCurve. The execution will never break there.
	Also, if you watch the data manager, the reference count on
	vectors will never go down, even when you delete the curves that
	use them.

	Fixing the problem in KstSharedPtr exposed other memory problems,
	hence the crashes. I've fixed one major problem, but there may be
	others left to be found. Now that objects are actually getting
	deleted previously hidden problems are emerging.

2004-06-05 Saturday 12:37  arwalker

2004-05-31 Monday 18:16  arwalker

	Added the concept of a readable name for plugins. This will be displayed in the plugin and fit dialog, and does not have to be the same as the function name. Thus, spaces can be used instead of underscores.

2004-05-28 Friday 04:12  staikos

	finally track down most of the mouse zoom handling issues.  very tricky, and
	I think this event handling code from KstView should be completely rethought.
	I started refactoring some of it but it clearly isn't working too well.

2004-05-27 Thursday 19:32  arwalker

	Added a layout mode toolbar button.

	Some additional thought needs to be taken with the different modes.

	Currently we have zoom modes, label mode, data mode, and layout mode.
	At present the zoom modes and label mode are radio buttons, while the
	latter modes are toggle buttons. This clearly should be changed, but to
	what needs some discussion.

2004-05-27 Thursday 15:36  arwalker

	IMPORTANT:
	You must now manually add vectors to the global list.  This is required in
	order to eliminate a [documented] race condition whereby a vector can be
	added to the global list while it is still in the constructor, then manipulated
	in another thread before the constructor completes.

	This eliminates the race and fixes most of piolib.  I removed the call to
	PIODeleteLink() because it was causing the crashes and I have no idea what it
	does.

2004-04-25 Sunday 16:05  staikos

	let's see what the thoughts are on the different MDI modes

2004-04-25 Sunday 15:46  staikos

	And now we start to horribly break Kst in order to integrate KMDI.

	- MDI is partially integrated
	- kst generally doesn't work
	- extensions are disabled until we rework viewObject()
	- testview is now a QWidget and a sample is created as an MDI child
	- updates are broken
	- some dcop interfaces are disabled

2004-04-25 Sunday 14:19  staikos

	rotate

2004-04-25 Sunday 00:54  staikos

2004-04-23 Friday 15:19  arwalker

	Added ability to align plots left, right, top, and bottom.
	Added ability to make plots same width, height, and size.

2004-04-23 Friday 13:16  arwalker

	Moved contentsRect( ) to KstViewObject, as this will be needed for proper resizing later.

2004-04-23 Friday 13:15  staikos

	Better handle resizing by only updating the aspect of child windows when necessary. This now allows us to shrink the parent to a very small size and retain the correct aspect ratios when the parent is restored to its original size.

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:50  staikos

	parentResized() should be recursive as noted, but updateFromAspect() should
	not be. - revert last, fix parentResized()

2004-04-22 Thursday 22:46  staikos

2004-04-22 Thursday 09:46  arwalker

	Several minor UI enhancements

2004-04-21 Wednesday 18:53  arwalker

	store the ascent information, fix computation of it, and therefore position the
	label properly in the buffer

2004-04-20 Tuesday 06:20  staikos

	added computation of the text geometry for the selected font and size, and
	support for justification.  Will need to split this into ascent and descent
	since subscript makes the text dip below the baseline.

2004-04-20 Tuesday 05:22  staikos

	implement ^ _ and {} in labels

2004-04-20 Tuesday 03:37  staikos

	back buffer implementation

2004-04-20 Tuesday 03:37  staikos

	a good chunk of the label parsing and rendering code.

	the parser will be slightly reworked after this.

2004-04-18 Sunday 02:17  staikos

	added support for dragging plot groups and undoing drags when re-entering the
	view that started the drag.  drag re-enter is buggy still.

2004-04-16 Friday 03:41  staikos

	dragging of Kst2DPlots is now partially functional within Kst instances.

2004-04-16 Friday 02:15  staikos

	more files, create a second view to test dnd

2004-04-16 Friday 02:14  staikos

	lots of view work, including most of drag and drop implemented - though it's
	still not functional

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:56  arwalker

	Some minor improvements to data mode:

	* remove the flicker when the mouse is moved, but the same data point remains selected
	* draw the data mode indicator more efficiently

	Also, if the x vector is not monotonic then we are stuck doing a linear search (N) for the nearest point. It might be worthwhile to do a quicksort of the vector (NlogN) which would initially be more costly but subsequent mouse moves would be much quicker. Given that there will generally be a lot of mouse moves while in data mode it will most likely be more efficient in the long run.

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:32  staikos

	ah now I understand, you didn't want orphans, you just wanted them to not be
	saved

2004-04-15 Thursday 14:20  staikos

	make these scalars really orphan

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:49  staikos

	proper fix for the bug in the list partitioner

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:44  staikos

	add testcase for bug recently fixed

2004-04-15 Thursday 13:42  arwalker

	Added some default scalar values that define some (hopefully) useful physical constants.
	These are deliberately orphaned so they are not saved with every kst file.

2004-04-15 Thursday 12:54  arwalker

	Prevent stray curves from remaining after we do File...New

2004-04-15 Thursday 11:57  arwalker

	This makes the whole thing work.

2004-04-15 Thursday 01:50  scripty

	CVS_SILENT made messages

2004-04-14 Wednesday 19:40  arwalker

	The plugin dialog update( ... ) function is really two seperate functions.
	One for updating the list of scalars and vectors within the input comboboxes
	and the other (already existing) to handle changes in the plugin itself.
	These functions have now been split, as previously creating a new
	scalar or vector within the plugin dialog would cause any modified
	settings to revert back to those of the last created plugin.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 18:10  mueller

	fix compile

2004-04-14 Wednesday 15:21  arwalker

	Fixed build problems.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 15:12  arwalker

2004-04-14 Wednesday 12:29  arwalker

	Plugin objects are updated as part of the ncl list now the underlying problem is fixed.

2004-04-14 Wednesday 12:22  arwalker

	Ensure that we don't add a NULL pointer to the exclusive list.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 20:52  staikos

	don't mask bugs, crash and then generate a bt with testcase so it can be fixed.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 19:01  arwalker

	Modification based on tests now that plugins are functional again.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 17:18  arwalker

	Update the plugin vectors in the new threading model.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 15:37  arwalker

	Perform some additional checks before using potentially invalid
	pointers. This prevents Kst from crashing when using plugins.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 15:18  arwalker

	Removed obsolete code.

2004-04-13 Tuesday 14:43  arwalker

	make the menus cascade when necessary, add ungrouping, more minor things

2004-04-12 Monday 18:44  staikos

	selection should be iterative over children, not recursive

2004-04-12 Monday 18:23  staikos

	added object grouping, fixed some bugs that showed up due to it

2004-04-11 Sunday 12:57  staikos

	Minor move, selection fixlets, and draw the bounding focus rect for a selection
	move instead of just the object that is focused.  This will later be changed to
	draw the focus rect for each object individually.  Bounds checking for move
	operations was added.

2004-04-11 Sunday 04:32  staikos

	allow selection of objects and move the selected items along with an item
	that is selected and moved.  Does not check bounds on selected items or draw
	the selected item shadows yet.  Selection markers are ugly. Resizing clears
	the selection.

2004-04-10 Saturday 20:57  staikos

	fix nasty bug on PPC and possibly some other architectures

2004-04-10 Saturday 19:43  staikos

	added the framework for labels in the new view engine
	The label parser and renderer needs a few changes before it can be ported over

2004-04-10 Saturday 16:44  staikos

	preserve aspect ratio during resize to keep with current Kst behaviour
	(also keeps relative sizing and positioning - basically the entire geometry
	aspect is preserved)

2004-04-09 Friday 16:54  arwalker

	A few UI issues

2004-04-09 Friday 16:32  arwalker

	Saves the event monitor entries to the kst file

2004-04-09 Friday 10:03  deller

	fix misplaced #endif - it broke when compiling w/ KDE CVS HEAD

2004-04-08 Thursday 20:22  arwalker

	Add functionality to prepare event monitor for saving to kst file

2004-04-08 Thursday 19:43  arwalker

	Event monitoring (in draft form) are now working:

	- all output is to the debug log
	- may want to add e-mail notification
	- may want to add visual feedback on curve, but it seems
	if this is the intent it could be done via the creation of an
	equation curve

2004-04-08 Thursday 16:54  arwalker

	Make the search for a unique Analysis Scalar and unique Anonymous
	Vector more efficient by remembering the last name that was used.

2004-04-08 Thursday 16:12  arwalker

	Removed a FIXME related to i18n not working

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:56  staikos

	much less flicker, and add new menu items for z-order manipulation

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:07  arwalker

	Provide a more efficient way to terminate the update thread
	Respect the plot update timer value

2004-04-08 Thursday 15:04  arwalker

	This is what was intended

2004-04-08 Thursday 12:59  arwalker

	Have KstView::printToGraphicsFile( ... ) return a bool to indicate whether or not it was successful.

2004-04-08 Thursday 06:23  staikos

	use "standard actions" that might be common across different view objects to
	reduce the effort it takes to write new objects

2004-04-08 Thursday 03:10  staikos

	iron out some context menu buglets (I'm getting good at finding weird mouse
	combinations), remove debug, and add in a bit smoother mouse movement.

2004-04-08 Thursday 01:52  staikos

	add a parent pointer, optimize a call, disable selection when not in
	layout mode

2004-04-08 Thursday 01:11  staikos

	that's a slot, not a signal

2004-04-08 Thursday 00:57  staikos

	fix some more weird mouse handling cases that were unhandled, add in menu
	titles

2004-04-07 Wednesday 22:25  staikos

	- many little fixlets in event handling.  some of them brown-paper-bag worthy
	- implemented popup menu plugin for objects
	- implemented deletion of objects from the context menu
	- enhanced the object API
	- optimized the rubberband.  it's now less flickery than the ones in Qt
	  and KDE even! (might just have to port this over)

2004-04-07 Wednesday 20:53  arwalker

	Made event monitor UI fit better with existing architecture

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:33  arwalker

	Removed an obsolete FIXME annotation

	Protect ourselves from the application also closing

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:06  arwalker

	Ensure a newly created extension is added to the relevant list so we know how to delete it and can avoid creating it again

2004-04-07 Wednesday 18:05  arwalker

	Ensure that the UI associated with the extension is removed when it is unloaded

2004-04-07 Wednesday 06:24  staikos

	added the start of drag objects for Kst objects and did some work on cleaning
	up coordinates and making view resize work like the old Kst views (still very
	far from working)

2004-04-07 Wednesday 03:25  staikos

	bounding for the rectangles for resize, select, and move, and some fixlets

2004-04-07 Wednesday 01:30  staikos

	rubber banding during move, resize, and selection.  selection is not
	implemented yet.  also fix a few buglets

2004-04-06 Tuesday 19:57  arwalker

	Continuing with the event monitoring

2004-04-06 Tuesday 16:46  staikos

	start the view in display mode now and add a checkbox to toggle layout mode
	in the test app (defaulted to on)

2004-04-06 Tuesday 16:24  staikos

	allow moving of objects

2004-04-06 Tuesday 15:20  staikos

	those coordinate calculations were wrong for top-left

2004-04-06 Tuesday 14:59  staikos

	Added mouse-driven object resizing - still requires user-feedback on size

2004-04-06 Tuesday 13:51  staikos

	oops :)

2004-04-06 Tuesday 13:47  staikos

	set the cursor over objects

2004-04-06 Tuesday 12:54  staikos

	Well it was too difficult to use "math" coordinates.  I was confusing myself
	endlessly.  Let's go back to u-l.  This makes cleanup work properly.  Now all
	features implemented so far are working.

2004-04-06 Tuesday 02:43  staikos

	fix focus rect and child searching

2004-04-06 Tuesday 02:24  staikos

	fix size coordinates

2004-04-05 Monday 23:43  staikos

	cleanup, clear, painting and sizing fixes - it's really broken now though, need
	to fix a few more things this broke (later)

2004-04-05 Monday 23:12  staikos

	more substantial demo of focus handling, drag&drop event handling partially
	done, selected flag added. view mode tracking added

2004-04-05 Monday 22:49  staikos

	lots of work on the new view code - painting and resizing works, focus works,
	and lots of utility functions added to the view object.  Event handlers are
	created but not all in use yet.

2004-04-05 Monday 15:34  arwalker

	Continue with event monitoring

2004-04-05 Monday 13:28  arwalker

	Update the event monitor dialog

2004-04-05 Monday 03:28  staikos

	some notes and geometry code

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:47  staikos

	to keep the code that uses this for comparisons cleaner

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:29  staikos

	CVS_SILENT

2004-04-04 Sunday 22:26  staikos

	Add in explicit deep copy support.  Been testing this one for a week now and
	it seems to be better and not much slower.  We need to make deep copies of the
	object lists we iterate if they are shared across threads.

	Prevented deadlock by moving:
	KstWriteLocker wl(&KST::vectorList.lock());
	beyond the call to vy = new KstRVector( ... )

	The problem was that KstRVector implicitly
	performs a write lock on KST::vectorList
	in the KstVector constructor. Hence the
	deadlock.

2004-03-18 Thursday 15:48  arwalker

2004-03-16 Tuesday 05:04  staikos

	track down what is perhaps the most difficult bug to find in Kst so far:
	can't iteratively lock children and then iteratively unlock them while doing
	a loadInputs() in between because the lists are modified in loadInputs()!
	The base implementation of the lock should be sufficient in this case since it
	only ever happens in KstDoc

	activate the new equation parser and interpreter.  It's hooked in
	inefficiently right now, and I have done very little regression testing, but
	it seems to work well enough to start wide testing.  Timings indicate it is,
	finally, requiring approximately 1/4 the amount of CPU time to evaluate the
	same equation as the old one, on average.  Regression tests to follow.

2004-02-13 Friday 06:40  staikos

	missed committing this file

2004-02-13 Friday 06:36  staikos

	implement more equation functionality including constants and powers, and
	start adding optimizations (constant folding so far - quite an improvement
	still!)

2004-02-12 Thursday 12:56  staikos

	- much more work on the interpreter and parser
	- hook in a demo with timings to demonstrate how much faster we are
	- interpret most of the old functions

	result: new code, with function calls, takes 1/3 the amount of CPU time as the
	        old parser.  In the absence of function calls, the differential is much
	        larger yet.  Constant folding and other optimizations could also be of
	        use.

2004-02-12 Thursday 10:52  staikos

	New KstEquation parser that should be many times faster than the current one.
	Still needs a bit of work before it can be plugged into KstEquation.

2004-02-10 Tuesday 21:45  staikos

	- Set the names of KstObjects so that they're more useful in JS
	- Add a signal to KstScalar::setValue() so that it can be hooked into for
	  the purpose of triggering events on values
	- Add bindings for KstScalars to the js code
	- Add a demo that shows how to execute code when a scalar reaches a certain

	- Add ability to load scripts from files (action merged with the UI)
	- Merge in the right place

2004-02-10 Tuesday 05:00  staikos

	renamed plancktoi->planckobj and TOI->Object to reflect the new meaning of the

2004-02-10 Tuesday 04:48  staikos

	Added "extension" framework to Kst which allows Kst to make use of optional

	make updates for derived vectors work with a huge kludge

2004-01-27 Tuesday 23:49  netterfield

	Add getIndexNearX(x) to kstbasecurve, which looks for the index near x.
	If the curve is monotonically rising, it uses a binary search.  Otherwise,
	it uses a linear search.

	Then use this function to re-do dataMode....

	It works - in that it does what I though I wanted it to do...

2004-01-26 Monday 21:54  staikos

	Make datamode work on shifted vectors with an absolutely disgusting hack that
	really should be removed ASAP.  SamplesPerFrame should be completely
	encapsulated within the vector and curve I think, but it isn't presently which
	means I need to pass it out via kstbasecurve and use it in kstview.  This

	Ensure that the vector select widgets are updated when a new curve is created through the Quick Curve dialog.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 16:09  arwalker

	Previously if the plugin dialog was open, with plugins installed, but no plugins had been used in the current session then adding a new vector through some other dialog would not result in the vector lists being updated in the plugin dialog. This has now been fixed.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 13:26  arwalker

	Added plugins from 'fits' subdirectory.

2004-01-20 Tuesday 13:25  arwalker

	Added unweighted linear fit

2004-01-20 Tuesday 05:12  staikos

	As the previous implementation wasn't considered "close enough", we now check
	the point rounded up and down (slight bias upward), and use the shortest
	distance instead of the closest Y point.  This is closer to the concept of
	the "closest data point".  It still falls apart with very steep graphs.

	Removed use of KstLabel in legend, as it was used only to

	performance will be better without it.
	Clean up of obsolete code.

2004-01-08 Thursday 22:58  staikos

	Add more synchronization, and track down a -nasty- gcc quirk:

	template<class T>
	class KstObjectList : public QValueList<T>

	1 KstObjectList(const QValueList<T>& x)
	2 KstObjectList(const KstObjectList<T>& x)

	gcc 2.95: Only calls copy constructor #2 (it ignores copy constructors of the
	          first form, which are really a typo anyway)
	gcc 3.3: Calls either one

	Since I had mistyped and used #1, it was crashing in very strange ways on my
	gcc 2.95 machine.  Unfortunately no valgrind there. :-)

	enough to demo multithreaded updates with one thread doing the updates.  Not
	sure if we can do better, but at least it's not in the GUI thread anymore.
	It's really horribly thread-unsafe in general though, so doing more than

2003-12-31 Wednesday 17:44  arwalker

	As text labels can be rotated it does not make sense to use a simple rectangle to define their bounding region, and this can make it very difficult for a user to select an existing label. We now use a region.

2003-12-31 Wednesday 15:15  arwalker

	Do not allow the size of the pixmap associated with a text label to be increased in size during a drag operation else a partially uninitialised pixmap will be drawn during the drag. This is only a problem when the size of one of the dimensions of the label is greater than the corresponding screen size.

	Make scalars work by name, and make the filter create a scalar with a given
	name if it is specified but it doesn't exist.  This may not be ideal but it's
	the most convenient implementation right now.  For some reason when scalars
	are changed for a plugin, the plugin doesn't update.

	Make filters work in the case of a filterset with exactly 1 filter defined,
	and only constants for the input scalars.  Fixes to follow, including
	save support.  Also seems that a bug in gcc 3.3-prerelease (suse) was
	tripped by this code, but I was unable to make a good testcase so far.

	enhance the context menu to allow the user to easily add and remove curves and
	delete plots

	fixlets and exposing a function for use in datapush

2003-09-17 Wednesday 16:36  staikos

	minor bug fix

2003-09-15 Monday 21:40  staikos

	fix various label drag issues as discussed on the list, including:

	- labels may only be dragged in label mode
	- labels may be editted and deleted again

	Common Case speedup: redraw of large vectors after zooming

2003-09-12 Friday 18:54  staikos

	fix painting and add a small fudge factor to get the label to fall in the
	"exact" right place without any offset

2003-09-12 Friday 18:00  staikos

	minor glitch fixes and polishing for label drags

	drags now work quite well I think

2003-09-12 Friday 17:49  staikos

	hotspot changes as discussed - labels now drag from the point selected and drop
	exactly where they appear to be dropping.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:37  staikos

	eliminate the garbage in the drag pixmap.  Unfortunately it still doesn't paint
	into the pixmap properly so we get a blank pixmap, or a pixmap with tiny
	writing in it now.  Will have to debug this later.

2003-09-11 Thursday 22:24  staikos

	cleanups, and fix drag initiation detection.

	Drag is re-enabled in non-label mode to see how the interaction is (and see if
	it should be left in or reverted).  It seems to work well for me but it may or
	may not be unexpected/interfere with zooming.  It is however convenient.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:53  staikos

	only allow label drags in label mode for now.  proper drag start should be
	added later to avoid the problem of zoombox initiating a drag.

2003-09-11 Thursday 21:47  staikos

	draggable labels - basically works, but still a bit buggy

	problems:
	 - the drag pixmap gets corrupted somehow
	 - dragging to other plots causes the extents to be temporarily broken
	 - the pixmap is centred around the hotspot, but drawn (top,left) at the
	   hotspot after the drop.  (which should we change?)

2003-09-11 Thursday 19:10  staikos

	A whackload of minor/insignificant cleanups, and make the label dialog clear
	out the entry field when creating new labels in order to distinguish from the
	case where the user clicked on an existing label in order to edit it.  This is
	particularily important for cases where the user clicks close to an existing
	label but accidentally misses it.

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	put a title on the context menu

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:17  staikos

	Shift and Ctrl should not override label mode

2003-09-11 Thursday 18:07  staikos

	Lots of code cleanup, and make the mouse pointer an arrow over labels (the
	existing code was incorrect)

2003-09-11 Thursday 17:13  staikos

	Add the rest of the context menu stuff requested in the TODO

2003-09-11 Thursday 15:04  staikos

	Create the context menu requested in the TODO file.  Added "Edit" and "Delete"
	so far.  Still need to add the more advanced items.

2003-09-01 Monday 09:41  staikos

	revert last.  kst must compile with 3.1 also.

2003-08-10 Sunday 20:45  staikos

	more GUI cleanups

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:52  staikos

	UI enhancements (part 1)

2003-08-10 Sunday 16:38  staikos

	Convert vectors to using a map.  It's still not what I would consider 'clean'
	because we don't use this everywhere yet.  Infact, there are cases that still
	using private members instead of the input lists for their vectors.
	This is purely for performance reasons.  There is no harm now because we don't
	even use the input lists for anything externally, but we might in the future.
	For now, all is good.

	Also fixes some crashes I stumbled across.  More uncovered bug fixes to follow.

2003-08-08 Friday 16:01  staikos

	after a marathon regression testing, valgrinding, and debugging, I think I can
	safely say that the list->map conversion of scalar inputs and outputs works and
	vector conversion can be done too.

2003-08-07 Thursday 15:22  staikos

	remove scalarlist.h - not needed

2003-08-07 Thursday 14:52  staikos

	- fix a memory corruption problem in main due to double delete of the mainwindow
	in some cases

	- only update the necessary parts of the data manager.  this is implemented in a
	rather slow way (the code is ~O(n^2)) but it is more reliable for now.  In the
	future we should tell the datamanager what to do, as opposed to telling it to
	update and having it determine what needs to be updated.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 21:33  staikos

	by default, zero memory on resize().  uses memset() for now, but an alternative
	method is also provided.

2003-08-05 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	We decided that this is the proper output for the test.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:18  staikos

	notes about what remains CVS_SILENT

2003-07-30 Wednesday 01:04  staikos

	Plenty of updates to the test suite.  Now generates plots and output.  Fixed
	a couple of minor bugs from before, and added option -v to specify to run Kst
	inside valgrind.

	Latest results:
	  - valgrind clean except for UMRs when accessing unset data inside vectors
	    (not so bad, still not sure what to do)
	  - printing empty plots fails (KPrinter mode)

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:57  staikos

	fix another crash found by regression tests, and implement printing images and
	postscript from dcop.  Seems to have trouble with printing empty plots in
	postscript, though printing empty plots to images works.  Could indicate a bug
	in the printing code.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 00:10  staikos

	fix testcases 169,170,172,174 and put in a compiled-out solution idea for
	testcases 190,191

2003-07-29 Tuesday 21:54  staikos

	a regression test script for Kst.  So far it seems to trigger approximately
	half a dozen bugs.

2003-07-29 Tuesday 20:58  staikos

	traced down a UMR, and a nasty bug that was resulting in complex crashes:
	main() is far too complex.  It should do much less, or be refactored.  The
	problem is that there are too many codepaths, and KstApp* was not being
	deleted, resulting in kstdoc not being deleted, resulting in the global lists
	being nonempty (and the static destruction trying to empty them, of course in
	the wrong order!).

	(this was found with the new regression testing scripts)

2003-07-27 Sunday 09:18  mueller

	compile (gcc 3.4+)

2003-07-25 Friday 22:58  netterfield

	Fix minor math error

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:37  staikos

	add ability to create vector curves, and fix plot creation slightly (it's still
	a bit broken in that the newly created plots seem to take over the screen until
	the plotlist is manipulated again.  will track this down later.)

2003-07-22 Tuesday 16:02  staikos

	plot manipulation functions exposed to dcop.  can create, delete, list, and list
	contents of plots.  can also add and remove curves.  extended plot manipulation
	is still missing.

2003-07-22 Tuesday 12:30  staikos

	vector manipulation dcop interface, and scalar creation support

2003-07-22 Tuesday 11:58  staikos

	many new dcop methods added, and scalars can now be set by assignment of a
	double.  It's now possible to generate equation plots of all sorts with dcop,
	manipulate scalars, generate vectors, list vectors, list objects, list scalars,
	list inputs and outputs, save vectors, and more!

2003-07-21 Monday 14:07  staikos

	vector saving is complete, including progress dialog and error messages

2003-07-18 Friday 18:32  staikos

	Allow vectors to be saved to disk.  UI doesn't keep sync with the vector list
	at all times yet (needs at least one fix still), and there is no error reporting
	in the saving code yet.  Also might switch the vector saving code to use
	QTextStream instead of snprintf+write.

2003-07-18 Friday 16:34  staikos

	bump version number to indicate post 0.91, add code for saving vectors (unused).
	Also fill in the about data some.

	Stick with ~clean interpolation with bounds checking.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:17  staikos

	don't jump around in the dialogs when an update(-1) is triggered.  this is a bit
	of a hack, but it works flawlessly so far and it's safer than changing the logic
	of update() everywhere.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 19:05  staikos

	drop the references before updating the plot dialog

2003-07-15 Tuesday 18:46  staikos

	minor cleanups in the plot dialog, and put some assert()s and remove some

	- make kstvector explicitly ref count to be safe

2003-07-15 Tuesday 14:10  staikos


	switch to using a QDict for scalars, and make sure they are cleaned up when the
	parent vector is done with them.  Unfortunately QDict<KSharedPtr<foo> > doesn't
	seem to work too well so this may not last.

2003-07-15 Tuesday 12:00  netterfield

	CPU usage bug in kstrvector fixed
	rework menues

2003-07-15 Tuesday 10:40  staikos

2003-07-14 Monday 20:44  staikos

	-very- close to perfect ref counting (and thus working purging) now.  the only
	remaining problem is that the data manager doesn't display the ref count for
	vectors quite correctly.

2003-07-14 Monday 20:40  staikos

	almost there - only a few extra references are hanging around now!

2003-07-14 Monday 20:08  staikos

	- repair the previous commit
	- remove more stored curve lists.  the hide() trick doesn't work for obvious
	  reasons

2003-07-14 Monday 19:47  staikos

	clean some sprintf()

2003-07-14 Monday 19:35  staikos

	some ref counting fixes, with purge of objects enabled.  still more to be done.

2003-07-14 Monday 18:48  staikos

	- plot dialog doesn't need to keep the curve list around
	- update the data manager last
	- don't access the empty combobox in the curve placement widget

2003-07-14 Monday 12:00  netterfield

	Vector and Rvector work
		-fixed interpolation bugs
		-only the first sample in the last frame is read to make

	psd's use output vectors instead of locally allocated arrays
	output vectors now work from psd's
	fixed 1 off bug in kstvector::interpolate()

2003-07-10 Thursday 05:43  staikos

	some work towards getting the usage counts back in sync

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:53  staikos

	- usage note for kstplugin
	- only activate Edit and Delete buttons when they're meaningful

2003-07-10 Thursday 04:41  staikos

	lots of cleanup, bug fixing, and error handling.  This stuff can now handle
	all kinds of crazy errors like invalid input files, and recover with as much
	information as possible.  For instance, it's now possible to load a plugin with
	invalid input or no output vectors defined and it will notify the user, mark
	the plugin, and wait for it to be repaired.

	fix bug: error bars were inverted - set none, it tries to use *end().  set one

	add license and copyright

2003-07-07 Monday 16:58  staikos

	- use a static deleter
	- convert the rest of the color stuff that I could find to use KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:36  staikos

	convert to KstColorSequence

2003-07-07 Monday 16:27  staikos

	re-add the color changer.  Could use some enhancement by the artistically

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:04  staikos

	graphics.ui is unused, and fix the layouts on graphfiledialog a bit

2003-06-26 Thursday 02:00  staikos

	- allow doubleclick in the data manager to bring up the editor dialog

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:48  staikos

	Make sure Apply Edits is the default button on the dialogs.  Also get vector
	lists with <None> working in the vector selector.  Works in the curve dialog
	now.

2003-06-26 Thursday 01:30  staikos

	leak fixes, and add <None> vector to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:47  staikos

	layout fix for plugin dialog, as well as a bug fix.  minor fixes to the scalar
	selector, including a double validator.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 20:29  staikos

	add the scalar selector, which uses the scalar editor.  Integrate it with the
	plugin dialog to start.  Also bugfixes in the plugin dialog, and in the vector
	selector.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:46  staikos

	The rest of the data manager dialogs use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:23  staikos

	Use VectorSelector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 18:08  staikos

	switch to the vectorselector

2003-06-25 Wednesday 17:40  staikos

	Add the vector selector widget, along with implementing it in the equation
	dialog.  Seems quite useful so far.
	Also cleanup the vector dialog a bit.
	Also fix that annoying bug where it wouldn't display on startup.  Unfortunately
	it's nothing more than a hack, really.

2003-06-25 Wednesday 15:39  staikos

	a scalar editor dialog for creating custom scalars.  presently unused.  the idea
	is to go from comboboxes or lineedits to actually having a kstvectorselector
	and a kstscalarselector, with a creator button where applicable.

	remove some code that has lost its usefulness

2003-06-25 Wednesday 00:25  staikos

	vector dialog now uses globalInstance().  Reconnect it to hs, psd and curve
	dialogs as it was before.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 23:49  staikos

	A whole bunch of refactoring.  DataObjects now have a showDialog() method
	which if implemented will show the proper dialog for that object.  KstApp no
	long needs to store eq/plugin/hs/psd/curve dialogs.  Others may follow.  There
	is also no need to do type identification on the object to determine which
	dialog to show it in.

	Dialogs now may emit "modified" to update kstdoc.

	Pointer to KstDoc in dialogs is now deprecated, and hopefully will be fully
	eliminated in the future.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 21:28  staikos

	- clean up our slave vectors and scalars when data objects are deleted.
	- clean up KstFiles when RVectors are removed
	- start to add Purge code, but it doesn't seem to work right.  I think there are
	  still stale references to objects around.  At least it won't crash now, but
	  cleaning up just doesn't work right yet.

2003-06-24 Tuesday 20:43  staikos

	1) I somehow reverted my fix, so restore it: must add to existing plots before
	   adding new ones otherwise the combobox gets desynced.
	2) rework the plugin handling a bit - should work better now
	3) don't allow vectors/scalars to be created with existing labels
	4) vectors/scalars created with blank tag get one automatically assigned.

	some cleanups and roaming user fixes: use readPathEntry/writePathEntry instead of readEntry/writeEntry where necessary

2003-06-21 Saturday 00:21  netterfield

	Removed doc dependency from dialogs - use signals.
	Fix hang bug in quick psd dialog
	Fix nan/infinity bug in kstvector.

2003-06-20 Friday 18:52  staikos

	beginnings of session code, not done though.

2003-06-20 Friday 16:14  staikos

	Let kmainwindow store the toolbar/size/etc settings for us

2003-06-20 Friday 14:54  staikos

	factor out more addPlot() code

2003-06-20 Friday 14:41  staikos

	wipe out another copy of addPlot()

2003-06-20 Friday 14:37  staikos

	enable placement in psds, and refactor addPlot as well as make it more
	generally useful and robust

2003-06-20 Friday 13:49  staikos

	moc doesn't like variables in the slots section

2003-06-20 Friday 13:47  staikos

	bye bye quick equations.  they can now be done from the equation dialog, or
	via dcop.

	Also added a routine to create vectors via dcop.  However it makes regular
	vectors which are therefore orphans.  If we decide that this is useful, I guess
	we should make a governor/owner for these things.  In any case, it's useful
	for testing purposes right now.

2003-06-20 Friday 13:32  staikos

	set correct values for the vector's scalars

2003-06-20 Friday 13:17  staikos

	make eqdialog have a curve placement widget and use it.  refactor a bit, with
	much more to come.  a bit more dialog cleanup in place also.  Unfortunately
	there is a bug in eqdialog that makes the plot not use the proper coordinates
	to display with when creating a new plot.  I'll have to try to track this
	down later.

	kstvector now has a method to generate a vector - this didn't belong in
	kstequationcurve.

2003-06-20 Friday 10:11  netterfield

	Limited functionality Arbitrary lables. (Not editable)
	Bug fix in kstplotdialog_i
	some signal re-working

2003-06-20 Friday 01:49  staikos

	CVS_SILENT

2003-06-20 Friday 01:48  staikos

	- add a demo dcop interface.  has methods to list the scalars, list the vectors,
	create an equation plot (basic, slightly incomplete, but usable), and show the
	data manager dialog

	- add a method to kstobjectlist to generate a list of the tagnames

	- notes on refactoring

	-

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:45  staikos

	more conversion to curveplacementwidget

2003-06-19 Thursday 23:18  staikos

	factor out the curve placement code.  Not much gained in terms of lines of code,
	but the ability to change things centrally is nice, and the api is cleansed a
	bit too.

2003-06-19 Thursday 21:32  staikos

	more conversions to the new curve appearance widget, and add more features to it

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	CVS_SILENT for designer

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:56  staikos

	convert to using the new factored out widget

2003-06-19 Thursday 19:36  staikos

	the first refactoring in the dialogs.  This one pulls out curveappearance and
	makes it a separate widget.  It is implemented presently using a "Custom
	Widget" in designer.

	The equation dialog was also enhanced with some setEnabled(bool) connections
	to disable things that can't be used, a horizontal rule, some rearranging, etc

2003-06-17 Tuesday 21:32  staikos

	some cleanup and bug fixes, get rid of null vectors (does this break rvector
	at all? I would think that it does, but I can't see anything broken), and
	put an explicit show() on the view after loading a document to make sure it
	paints.

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:24  staikos

	fix memory corruption

2003-06-17 Tuesday 19:02  staikos

	file saving and loading is mostly repaired, along with some memory corruption
	in kstplot.

2003-06-15 Sunday 12:58  staikos

	switch to using NaN for NOPOINT

2003-06-13 Friday 22:21  netterfield

	Better label dialog
	Fixed auto labels

2003-06-13 Friday 19:20  netterfield

	minor cleanups:
	  -remove commented out code
	  -remove unused variable

2003-06-13 Friday 19:15  netterfield

	Fixed scalar substitution in labels.
	Labels now use the KST::scalarList global.
	The scalar list no longer needs to be passed through kstplot.

2003-06-13 Friday 18:49  netterfield

	Fix to symbol font in kstlabels

	not needed

2003-06-12 Thursday 21:26  netterfield

	First steps in adding arbitrarily placable labels....
	Reworked KstMouse in KstView
	Added action

2003-06-12 Thursday 18:31  staikos

	scatter some typenames throughout to make gcc3 happy

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:48  staikos

	add an isNull accessor here, if kstrvector is going to make it null.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:34  staikos

	More of the refactoring done.  slave vectors are history, and shared pointers
	are used almost everywhere now.  Only curves and plots are unshared.  Many
	potential bugs were fixed, and memory doesn't seem to leak, though I haven't
	checked the "reachables" yet according to valgrind.  There are no other
	memory errors to my knowledge.  The only remaining problems are that "Purge"
	doesn't work yet.  This is related to usage count being broken.  There is
	still plenty of cleanup to do, including removing unused variables and member
	variables, unused methods, and some renaming.  There is also some logic that
	can be removed now because it duplicates existing logic.

	The lists that were once in kstdoc are now in a KST:: namespace and global
	in order to facilitate linking purposes and ease of use.  Now scalars and
	vectors add themselves to the global lists automatically.

	Full diff is ~4600 lines.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:22  staikos

	it helps to use the new variable

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:19  staikos

	another access beyond the end of the array while interpolating.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:10  staikos

	don't access beyond the end of the array when scaling

2003-06-10 Tuesday 14:19  staikos

	more cleanup, remove some debug, convert to typedefs instead of big template
	expressions, etc.

2003-06-10 Tuesday 12:50  staikos

	remove some debug, add a compile fix for the new RESTORE() macro

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:08  staikos

	some cleanup

2003-06-10 Tuesday 01:03  staikos

	KstFile is now a KstObject.  Needs more work, but everything is functional
	it seems, except perhaps purging.

2003-06-09 Monday 19:36  staikos

	The next big round of changes - no more *vector*list classes anymore.  This is
	basically as functional as before, but quick(psd|equation|*) may not quite
	work right at the moment.  This is easily fixed later.

	There are two known memory errors which will go away as KstFile becomes a
	shared object, and as the Vector classes are reworked for the final time.
	They don't appear to cause much of a problem right now.

2003-06-03 Tuesday 01:42  staikos

	First major portion of the cleanup - refactor into KstDataObjects, not counting
	KstFile.  Vectors are not changed.  This removes all kinds of code duplication
	though much still remains.  Some things are still not ideal but they're
	getting closer.  It is quite likely that this patch broke things, but the very
	basics still seem to work fine.

	Removes 1000-1500 lines of code.

2003-06-02 Monday 20:08  staikos

	more reworking of the classes - dataObjectList is now used in kstdoc, though
	the curves are still separate

2003-06-02 Monday 15:35  staikos

	add debug temporarily to track usage

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:12  staikos

	count()->length() for the vector

2003-06-01 Sunday 18:11  staikos

	Some of the changes to the vectors are started.  I'm doing these incrementally,
	and periodically somethings may break.  For instance, vector usage counts
	probably do not work right now, though they will work again once the changes
	are complete.  This change mostly changes method names, adds some new ones,
	removes some that need to disappear, etc.  The next change will likely be
	the use of KSharedPtr<> instead of the raw pointer (which will -mostly- fix
	the usage count again).  There are probably memory leaks right now.

2003-06-01 Sunday 17:20  staikos

	more cleanup

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:44  staikos

	cleanups

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:30  staikos

	- kstscalarlist.cpp is no longer needed
	- fix a bug in kstcurvedialog where it didn't plot in an existing plot AND
	  in a separate plot

2003-06-01 Sunday 16:25  staikos

	Most finish the Scalar conversion to the new object model.  Seems to have
	cleaned up many memory issues, as well as removed lots of code!  There is
	still much more code to remove or change to using iterators too.

2003-05-28 Wednesday 17:16  staikos

	it is in use already, but it's the next one to integrate.

2003-05-25 Sunday 14:23  staikos

	this should not be in CVS

2003-05-25 Sunday 13:04  staikos

2003-05-23 Friday 17:15  staikos

	edit fixes, still not fully working.  Data manager gets confused.

2003-05-23 Friday 16:48  staikos

	clean up vectors when new plugin fails

2003-05-23 Friday 16:15  staikos

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:25  netterfield

	Made kstvector a kstdataobject
		this breaks d2asc compiles, but kst is still OK: Help
	Made doc->scalarList a static member of kstvector, so that kstvectors
		can insert their scalars into the list.

	I think it would be better to add doc->scalarList to KstScalar
		and doc->vectorList as static member of KstVector so things
		can insert and delete themselves!

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:17  staikos

	don't double delete

2003-05-22 Thursday 19:07  staikos

	Fix vector leaks

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:52  staikos

	make the dialog show the correct combobox values in edit mode.

2003-05-22 Thursday 17:23  staikos

	Lots of plugin work.  Unfortunately the vector architecture is becoming a real
	problem now.  I had to put in lots of hacks that could go away if we make all
	vectors the same (or specialised) as discussed.  I think this has to happen
	sooner rather than later.

	The vector list classes need to be reworked too.

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:39  staikos

	fix scalar parsing in the XML and add widget spacing to the generated dialog

2003-05-22 Thursday 11:28  staikos

	call the plugins

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:26  staikos

	- change the default action in plugin dialog from delete to save
	- make kstdataobject KShared because eventually all dataobjects will be
	  KShared probably.
	- return const QString& from accessor in kstdataobject
	- note about vector and scalar lists moving into kstdataobject eventually

2003-05-21 Wednesday 23:01  staikos

	- fix a bug in plugins since the change to KstDataObject
	- make the plugin code generate unique names like the other objects
	- add plugins to the data manager window (without the vectors currently)

2003-05-21 Wednesday 21:57  staikos

	move "Loaded" over one column.  It looks better to select the plugin name, not
	it's loaded state pixmap.

2003-05-21 Wednesday 14:35  netterfield

	Fix update bug:
		call update on all dependancies liberally
		call update on all slaves
		use a counter to avoid re-updates
		note: recursion is not detected, will produce junk results, but

	Especially in cases where the parameter had a default value.

	Also some i18n() and other cleanup.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 18:18  staikos

	- some i18n fixes
	- get rid of unnecessary casts
	- don't cast (QString)"foo".  Use QString("foo") if really needed, or better,
	  rework it so it can be i18n("")
	- (float)foo -> float(foo) etc
	- const bool& is a bad idea and does nothing of benefit over bool.

2003-05-07 Wednesday 18:03  staikos

	more const/inheritence cleanup

2003-05-07 Wednesday 17:44  staikos

	better be safe with free()

	Also cleanups, refactorizations, micro optimisations

2003-05-07 Wednesday 16:29  staikos
