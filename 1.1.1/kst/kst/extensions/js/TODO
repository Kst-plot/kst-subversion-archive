Major:
- more verbose error messages (ie: which argument is wrong, and why)
- what should we do for toString()?  It's basically empty in all classes
- "delete" support - in order drop references?
- Possible to create duplicate tagnames with current script code
- use inheritence to make it less tedious to implement bindings
- Plots are flattened from inside windows - will be a problem when plot groups
  are accessible - what to do?


General Completion:
- need to finish plugin bindings - after freeze
- input and output map for data objects


Would be nice:
- save and load state
- object browser GUI
- multiple interpreters?
- dump list of loaded files
- many bindings lack good [or any] bindings (ComboBox, list{view,box}, etc)
- string comparisons are too slow - at least use ustring
- collection class is read-only presently - make read-write
