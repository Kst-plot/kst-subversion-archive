0.9.0 TODO LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* L10N fixes:
	o informations -> information
	o ?? Credit -> Credits (need native Speaker?  There's e.g. about.addCredit() method not about.addCredits()

* right hand side sidebar (allee):
	o Select an album 
        o click on some empty space in the thumbnail view (-> selected image changes from blue selection
          background to dotted line (aka still has keyboard focus, right?)
        o Now select tabs in right hand side:
		+ Properties, metadata..: everyhing is disabled
		+ comments/tags tab on the other hand  shows info about the image with keyboard focus
        Shouldn't every tab show now it's info in this case? (alternatively disable comments/tags too)

* ImageEditor:

   - Polish keyboard focus in sidebar when navigate between album pictures.

* Main Interface:

   - Finalize IPTC keywords tags parsing to create new digiKam tags in database when new images are imported.

* Media support:

    o Testing 3 plug cases with GPhoto camera
        1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
            -> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
               be in the list. 
        2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
            -> as 1) but already instance should be used
            (uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
            if necessary
        3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
           camera is already connected
            -> camera menu allows to 
                select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
                to start download dialog
                ditto for unmounting in usm case
